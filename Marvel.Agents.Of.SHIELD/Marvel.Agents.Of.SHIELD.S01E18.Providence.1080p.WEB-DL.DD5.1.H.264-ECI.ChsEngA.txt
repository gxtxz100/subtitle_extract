漫威《神盾局特工》前情回顾Previously on "Marvel's agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."...
这一定是发送给神盾局内部的It's got to be some sort of activation signal
九头蛇成员的激活信号to Hydra members within S.H.I.E.L.D.
弗瑞局长死了Director Fury is dead.
如果九头蛇真夺下了这架飞机If Hydra is really about to seize this plane --
我们得清除系统We should wipe the system.
我正在备份到硬盘上以防万一I'm backing it up on this hard drive to keep our edge.
快把加勒特特工抓起来Take Agent Garrett into custody.
他就是被称为千里眼的杀人凶手He's the murderer they call the Clairvoyant.
你之前打死了假的千里眼You shot the wrong Clairvoyant before.
想对真正的千里眼开枪吗Care to shoot the right one?
站住Stop right there.
你来干什么What are you doing here?
千里眼送来的礼物A gift from the Clairvoyant.
今天  全球最领先的情报机关Today, world leaders are scrambling for answers
遭遇一系列攻击的重创后after the world's most advanced spy agency
各国领袖都在迫切地寻找答案was crippled by a series of attacks.
-总统声称...  -长官- The president contends  - Sir.
这是史上最严重的情报泄露...this is the biggest intelligence leak...
找到马丁特工Find Agent Martin.
我们需要跟联合国建立联络we need a back channel to the U.N.,
找个我们信任的人someone we trust. ...
从神盾局泄露的资料the documents released from S.H.I.E.L.D.
我列出了安全的神盾局基地清单I made a list of S.H.I.E.L.D. bases we believe are secure.
多少  七个吗How many so far? Seven?
三个Three.
再加上中心Plus the Hub.
包括中心Including the hub.
这只是初步清单  之后还会有更多的It's a preliminary list. I'm sure more will turn up.
...国会召集了调查小组...the congress are calling for a investigate panel,
但目前仍不清楚谁该为此事负责but it's still unclear who should be held accountable.
神盾局的多位高官失踪Many of its leaders have vanished,
-神盾局支离破碎  -你是对的- leaving s.H.I.E.L.D. fractured...  - You were right all along.
将这些秘密都公诸于世Having all this out there in the world
只会带来危险  而如今makes it too dangerous, and now...
没有人来保护这个世界了there's no one left to protect it.
还有我们There's us.
我们能活下来就很幸运了We were lucky enough to make it through.
三曲翼总部  中心The triskelion, the hub...
这些战役只是战争的开始Those battles are just the beginning of this war.
如今九头蛇卷土重来Hydra's out there now,
但至少我们的队伍还是完整的but at least our team's still intact.
我们能对抗他们We can fight them,
并会一战到底and we will.
古巴  哈瓦那
欢迎回来  沃德先生
要刮胡子吗
我还是再留段时间吧  厄涅斯托
千里眼约我们在这种地方见面吗This is where we're meeting the Clairvoyant?
没必要再那么称呼我了There's no need to call me that anymore.
叫我约翰就行Name's John.
约翰·加勒特John Garrett.
看来你以为我会长得像个算命先生Guess you were expecting more the fortune-teller type.
很荣幸终于能见到你It's an honor to finally meet you.
别这么说  是我的荣幸Please, the pleasure's all mine.
你在蜈蚣计划上完成得很出色You've done great work for us on the centipede project.
是你的天赋让我找到了方向It was your gift that showed me the way.
抱歉了  花裙妹  我要让你失望了Sorry, flowers. I hate to disappoint you.
我没有什么天赋I never had any gifts,
至少没有你以为的那种at least not the kind you believed in.
只是有很高的神盾局安全权限Just a very high level S.H.I.E.L.D. security clearance
还有and
极强的说服力persuasive personality.
你没有千里眼的能力You're not clairvoyant?
没有Hardly.
不过如果能让你好受些But if it's any consolation,
相信我是千里眼的人远不止你一个you weren't alone in believing, not by a long shot.
这么说你是个骗子So you're a liar.
假冒的You're a fraud.
我是大师An artist.
虽说是骗术大师  但也是大师啊A con artist, perhaps, but an artist all the same.
总得想办法蒙蔽住神盾局Had to pull the wool over S.H.I.E.L.D.'s eyes somehow
好达成我们的目标to do what we set out to do.
记得是什么吗Remember what that was?
改变世界To change the world.
过来坐下吧Why don't you take a seat?
我让你看看我们在怎么改变And let me show you how we're doing that?
别担心  我不会让厄涅斯托剪你的头发的Oh, don't worry. I wouldn't dream of letting Ernesto cut your hair.
欢迎加入九头蛇Welcome to Hydra.
你得换掉地线You need to replace the grounding wires.
时间不够了There's no time.
舷梯必须今天修好Ramp needs to be repaired by the end of the day.
科尔森的命令Coulson's orders.
什么  还有命令这回事吗What? Are they even proper orders?
神盾局被毁了  弗瑞死了S.H.I.E.L.D.'s been destroyed, Fury's dead.
只能说是请求了吧Aren't they just requests?
不管怎样  我已经在弄了Well, either way, I'm in the middle of it.
-他可没听谁的命令  -定子- Well, he's certainly not taking orders from anyone. - Stator, please.
现在神盾局被定为了恐怖组织We have no jurisdiction now that S.H.I.E.L.D.'s
我们都没有管辖权了been labeled a terrorist organization.
高层会处理这些事的Powers that be will sort it out.
我们能做的就是一次修好一个东西All we can do is fix one thing at a time,
从伺服驱动器开始starting with this servo drive.
是  你说得对Yeah. You're right.
但你得把那些地线换掉However, you will need to replace those grounding wires.
没问题啊It's fine.
好了  打开吧Okay, turn it on.
赶紧关上Turn it off!
你得把地线换掉You need to replace the grounding wires.
你得闭嘴You need to shush.
都给我闭嘴Shush, both of you.
还一起教训我Honestly, ganging up on me.
觉得自己很聪明吗  那你们修吧Think you're so smart? Well, why don't you try to fix it?
-借过  -好消息- Excuse me  - Good news.
我们夺回了立方体监狱The Cube has been retaken.
所有九头蛇特工都被打跑了All Hydra agents have been flushed out and are on the run.
那么有四个安全基地了So that makes four.
看吧  我就说会有更多的See? Told you more would turn up.
飞机主体基本修复了The hull's almost completely repaired.
飞行系统也重新投入使用了Flight systems are back online.
舷梯呢And the cargo ramp?
菲兹向我保证能恢复正常Fitz assures me that it will be operational.
长官  有通话信号传入Sir, incoming transmission.
我是美国空军上校格伦·塔伯特This is colonel Glenn Talbot, U.S. air force.
我需要与负责人通话I need to speak with whoever's in charge over there.
塔伯特上校  我是菲尔·科尔森特工Colonel Talbot, I'm Agent Phil Coulson.
-很高兴我们能  -科尔森先生- I'm happy we could --  - Mr. Coulson,
你们给我们惹了好大麻烦It's a real mess your boys have gotten us into.
九头蛇打了我们个措手不及Hydra caught us by surprise.
你说得还真是保守Well, that's an understatement.
九头蛇能渗入那么高的级别很让人担忧It's troubling how deeply embedded Hydra was within your ranks.
我们也很头疼  长官Especially troubling for us, sir,
但我向你保证  我们已经开始反击But I assure you we're going on the offensive.
中心已经安全The Hub is secure.
所有剩余特工随时准备协助你的任何...All remaining agents stand ready to assist you in whatever --
我想神盾局的"协助"已经够我们I think we've had about all the assistance we can handle
忙活一阵的了from S.H.I.E.L.D.
我会派一支维和部队过去I'm sending in a peacekeeping force.
他们将全面接管They're gonna take control.
明白Understood.
我应该怎么对手下人说What should I tell my men to expect?
我们只想问几个问题We just want to ask a few questions,
了解一下形势get the lay of the land.
如果没什么问题  你们就可以自便了Everything checks out, you and your boys can be on your merry.
没问题Sounds good.
这下麻烦大了This doesn't sound good.
他绝对在说谎He's lying, definitely, for sure.
如果行动由塔伯特指挥If Talbot's leading the op,
那目的绝不是为了维和there's nothing peacekeeping about it.
基地防御运转正常  我们能抗住Base defenses are operational. We could hold out.
现在神盾局最不需要的The last thing S.H.I.E.L.D. needs
就是跟美国政府挑起战争is to start a war with the U.S. government.
塔伯特来了会怎么样What happens when Talbot gets here?
最好的情况  我们都被传讯Best-case scenario -- we all get subpoenas,
接下来六个月都要耗在法庭听证会上spend the next six months tied up in court hearings.
那最坏的情况呢Worst-case scenario?
他们跳过传讯Means they skip the subpoenas,
直接攻击基地move straight to bunker busters.
炸弹  大炸弹Bombs. Big bombs.
与此同时  九头蛇仍然逍遥在外All the while, Hydra's still out there.
联络空客  我们要执行奥德赛预案Get on the comms. We're enacting Odyssey protocol.
奥德赛预案  什么意思Odyssey protocol? What does that mean?
意思就是菲兹得赶快修好空客It means Fitz needs to finish his repairs.
我们要离开这里We're getting the hell out of here.
很多特工准备留下投降A lot of agents are staying behind to surrender.
希望他们能再考虑一下Wish they'd reconsider.
对付九头蛇  我们需要一切帮助We need all the help we can get to fight Hydra.
空客怎么样了How's the bus?
菲兹想办法修好了舷梯Fitz managed to jerry-rig the ramp,
但中心的燃料储备短缺but the Hub's fuel reserves were tapped out.
我们燃料不多了We're running low.
塔伯特还有不到一小时就降落了Talbot's landing in less than an hour.
你到底能不能把我们及时送上天Can you get us up in the air or not?
十分钟后起飞Have us wheels up in 10.
你们都要走了吗So, you guys are all set to go?
非常感谢你的帮助Appreciate your help.
那能给我一个铺位吗Enough to give me a bunk?
毕竟你们少了一个行动专家Seeing as you guys are down a specialist,
我想搭个便车I was hoping I could hitch a ride.
不可能Not gonna happen.
不过你可以随意征用一辆汉德的车But feel free to commandeer one of Hand's vehicles.
抱歉  有什么问题吗I'm sorry. Is there a problem?
没问题No problem.
就是不想让你上我的飞机Just not letting you on my plane.
加勒特骗了我  就像他骗了其他人那样Garrett had me fooled, same as everyone else.
其他人可没有天天和他在一起Everyone else wasn't at his side day in, day out.
我有朋友因他而死  十分要好的朋友Friends of mine are dead because of him...good friends.
我觉得他应该跟我们一起走  长官I think he should come with us, sir.
知道了  西蒙斯特工Duly noted, Agent Simmons.
但这事上没有民主可言But this isn't a democracy.
没有吗Isn't it?
如今这种情况下Under the circumstances,
我认为我们都该有发言权I think we should all have a say in this,
而且我亲眼目睹了崔普利特特工and I witnessed Agent Triplett willing to die
愿为保卫神盾局牺牲in defense of S.H.I.E.L.D.
恕我冒昧  长官Respectfully, sir,
我认为他应该跟我们一起走I think he should come along with us.
好吧Okay.
但崔普利特特工的一切行为由你负责But Agent Triplett is your responsibility.
我们需要消失We need to disappear.
只有神盾局的直升航母有隐形科技Well, only S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarriers have cloaking technology.
-那我们如何避开侦查  -我们避不了- Then how do we avoid detection?  - We don't.
我们只能尽量避开其他飞行器的雷达Best we can do is stay out of other aircraft's radar
并尽可能保持飞行and remain in flight for as long as possible.
着陆之后更难隐藏Minute we land, harder it is to hide.
这可好Great.
我们的供给情况怎么样How are we doing on supplies?
我们医疗储备充足We're all stocked up on medical,
但恐怕食物供给but I'm afraid our food rations
最多只能坚持几天will only last a couple of days, at best.
好极了Perfect.
坏消息Bad news.
还真是一个接一个No kidding.
燃料管线破了Fuel line's busted.
-我们在漏油  -能修好吗- We're leaking.  - Can we fix it?
当然  落地就能修Sure. Soon as we touch down.
棒极了Awesome.
斯凯  拜托给我点好消息Skye, please, tell me something good.
我们还有互联网We have Internet.
太好了Yay.
如今我的期望值可真低And, boy, have I lowered my expectations.
但所有总部的支持系统都没了But all H.Q. support systems are gone.
这样的话...Well, then,
就靠互联网了the Internet it is.
找到一切关于我们队伍的东西...Find everything you can on our team...
所有个人档案  照片  任何能证明我们存在的all personal records, photos, anything that proves we exist...
删除掉then erase it.
这可是不得已的下策Uh, that's kind of the nuclear option.
是我们唯一的选择It's our only option.
全世界所有政府机构都会追捕我们Every government agency in the world will be on our ass.
我们需要消失We need to vanish.
好吧  但是...Okay. But...
一旦删除后  就无法恢复了once that's done, that can't be undone.
我们会变成幽灵We'll be ghosts.
不是神盾局特工  而是...无名特工Not agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., just agents of...nothing.
沃德怎么样了What about Ward?
有他的消息吗Have you heard from him?
他和汉德特工He and Agent Hand
现在应该已经把加勒特送到冷藏库了吧should have dropped Garrett off at the Fridge by now.
还没消息Not yet.
给你  给他打个电话Here. Give him a call.
听到加勒特在狭小无窗的囚室Hearing how Garrett settled into his tiny,
永远安顿下来  也许能让我振奋一些windowless, permanent home might actually cheer me up.
完事之后  把大家的徽章收上来When you're finished, collect everyone's badges.
我们现在不能拿出去四处亮了It's no longer something we want to flash around.
看到塔伯特的部队了吗Any sign of Talbot's forces?
还没有  但我们只能再飞Not yet, but we've only got eight hours of flight time
八小时了before we have to land.
不超过四小时  燃料管线在漏油No more than four. Fuel line's leaking.
能说说我们要去哪吗Want to tell me where we're going?
我不知道I don't know.
格兰特·沃德
是科尔森It's Coulson.
接吧By all means.
长官Sir.
一切还好吗Is everything all right?
是我Hey, it's me.
只想告诉你一声格兰特·沃德已经不存在了I just wanted to let you know that Grant Ward no longer exists.
能解释一下吗  斯凯You want to explain that, Skye?
有个好战的上校威胁说要来中心一趟Some trigger-happy colonel threatened to pay The Hub a visit.
科尔森在他来抓我们之前带大家逃了Coulson had us evacuate before he could lock us all up.
格兰特·沃德
现在我在删除我们的一切信息Now I'm scrubbing our I.D.s
等科尔森想好我们下一步怎么办While Coulson figures out our next move.
有道理Makes sense.
汉德特工在附近找了几架海军飞机Agent Hand picked up some navy jets in the vicinity.
安全起见她要我们绕远路去冷藏库She has us taking the long route to the Fridge just to be safe.
你还真是处变不惊啊You took that surprisingly well.
你没听见吗  你已经不存在了Did you hear the part about you no longer existing?
这也不是我第一次遇到这种问题了Well, it's not the first time my identity's been compromised.
你知道科尔森准备带我们去哪吗Have any idea where Coulson has us headed?
不知道  我会跟你保持联络的No idea. I'll keep you posted.
好Good.
等我忙完了就去找你们I'll catch up with you when I can.
下次见你的时候  你想成为谁呢And when I see you next, who you gonna be?
你现在可以从零开始  做任何你想做的人You got a clean slate. You can be anyone you want.
我不知道I don't know.
也许  汤姆·布拉迪[著名四分卫]Maybe...Tom Brady.
我一直想打四分卫I always wanted to play quarterback.
然后跟超模约会  你可真好猜And date supermodels. You are so predictable.
我就是觉得那家伙过得好像蛮不错的No, I mean the guy seems to have things pretty worked out.
注意安全Be careful.
你也是You too.
汤姆·布拉迪  你不是讨厌爱国者队吗Tom Brady? You hate the Patriots.
她所认识的格兰特·沃德特工可不讨厌The Agent Grant Ward she knows doesn't.
你那套正人君子的伪装还真不赖Yeah, that straight version of you is something else.
大概连黑寡妇都做不到吧I don't even think Romanoff could pull that one.
要做到也是有代价的Well, it wasn't without its complications.
别这样Oh, come on.
你不会还在为那事不爽吧You're not still upset about that.
对斯凯开枪可不是计划的一部分Shooting Skye was not part of the plan.
几乎零接触  是这么说好的Near zero contact -- that was the deal going in.
不过关于那个大提琴家的信息派上了用场Though your tip about the cellist came in handy.
如果你对那姑娘有感觉  你就该早跟我说If you had a thing for the girl, you should have contacted me.
那样我就会事先征求你的同意I would have asked for your blessing.
别跟我玩你那套把戏Don't play your games with me.
-这不是开玩笑  -这不用你说- This isn't a joke. - You don't have to tell me.
你的小甜心被神盾局招募之前Your little candy crush was on centipede's tail
就在到处打听蜈蚣计划了long before she was recruited by S.H.I.E.L.D.
看起来是个急需解决的人  我的错Seemed like a good person to eliminate. My bad.
听着  如果这任务很轻松  就不会...Listen, if the job was easy, it wouldn't --
我的任务是混进去Yeah, the job was to blend in,
收集科尔森复活的情报  仅此而已gather intel on Coulson's revival. That's it.
你自己说过不想有人伤亡You said yourself you didn't want any bloodshed.
那是在我发现科尔森什么都不知道之前That was before I found out Coulson didn't know squat.
如果我一开始就让你杀人You know, you would have had an easier time
你可能会轻松得多if I gave the kill order week one.
是啊  但你没有Yeah. But you didn't.
那个姑娘  我明白  她很可爱The girl I get. She's cute.
但别忘了任务是什么But don't forget what the assignment was.
别忘了是谁安排的Don't forget who gave it to you.
也别忘了为什么And don't forget why.
振作点And cheer up!
我们接近目标了  比以往任何时候都接近We're close -- closer than ever.
设备都在这里So, the equipment's here.
你们要我干什么What do you want with me?
花裙妹  我要你继续负责Well, flowers, I'm putting you back in charge
蜈蚣计划  完成第三阶段of the centipede project to finish phase three.
我叫蕾娜It's Raina.
抱歉  习惯成自然Sorry. Force of habit.
我以为第三阶段早已结束I thought phase three ended
我没能从科尔森特工那里打探到塔希提岛的真相when I couldn't get the truth about Tahiti from Agent Coulson,
又被抓了起来when they locked me up.
正好相反  你的"劝导"On the contrary -- your little bedside chats
引他走向了正确的方向pushed him in the direction we needed.
别误会Don't get me wrong.
我们遭遇了不少挫折We've had more than a few setbacks.
我们测试了这些新药We've been testing these new drugs.
他们都有不同的编号They all have different numbers.
我们认为其中之一含有We thought one of them might contain
让科尔森起死回生的灵丹妙药whatever Jesus juice brought Coulson back from the dead.
你们在哪找到的Where did you find these?
在弗瑞给他动手术的地点At the facility where Fury operated on him.
科尔森亲自带我去的Coulson walked me in, hand in hand.
我想看看这个地方I'd like to see this facility.
很不幸  我们遇到了那里的白痴保安Unfortunately, ran into a couple of security chuckleheads
他们启动了自毁开关who decided to hit the kill switch.
我把能找到的小药瓶都塞进了背心里I loaded my vest with as many of these vials as I could find.
但它们似乎都没什么效果But none of them seem to be working quite right.
又这个表情There's the look.
我知道你在开动脑筋I can see your gears turning now.
我没什么天赋  蕾娜  但你有I don't have any gifts, Raina, but you do.
没有你的帮助我做不到I can't succeed without your help.
我需要钱  还有资源I'll need money. And resources.
已经给你的银行账户打了足够的资金Your bank accounts are already fully funded.
这块硬盘上有西蒙斯所有的研究成果This is a hard drive with all of Simmons' research,
包括科尔森和斯凯的血液检测both Coulson and Skye's blood work,
关于招待所药物的所有数据all the data on the Guest House drug.
一切潜在的关键资料If there's a key to how this stuff works,
都在这上面了you'll find it in there.
如果你还需要什么If you need anything else,
尽管说just whistle.
你们要去哪Where are you going?
神盾局守卫最森严的设施如今十分脆弱S.H.I.E.L.D.'s most secure facility is vulnerable right now.
冷藏库The Fridge?
你也听说过啊Oh, you've heard of it.
没错Yeah, well...
我们要去打劫we're gonna raid it.
这任务真不容易This wasn't easy.
西蒙斯给我的时候都快哭了Simmons got choked up when I asked for hers.
这对我来说意义重大This was big for me.
让我终于觉得有了归属感  可如今Finally felt like I was a part of something, and now...
再没有任何意义...it's worthless.
真抱歉I'm sorry.
无法想象这一切对你来说有多难接受I can't imagine what this is like for you.
你献出了自己的一生You gave your life --
甚至献过一条命给神盾局literally gave your life -- to S.H.I.E.L.D.
弗瑞招募我时  我比你还年轻I was younger than you when fury recruited me.
刚刚踏出高中校门Just out of high school.
有时候  感觉恍如昨日Some days, it feels like only yesterday.
但有时候Other days...
又仿佛已过去了很久...a lot longer.
那是你的徽章吗Is that your badge?
看起来像是坐标They look like coordinates.
哪里的坐标Coordinates to where?
暂时不清楚I don't know yet.
但只有一个人可能发这些坐标给我But there's only one person who could have sent these.
而这正是他的作风And this is totally his style.
这么说  弗瑞局长还活着So, Director Fury's alive?
他说了什么  有什么计划吗What did he say? Does he have a plan?
他只发来一个坐标He only sent coordinates.
坐标指向加拿大的一处荒野The coordinates should put us somewhere in the Canadian wilderness.
那里会有什么  长官What exactly are we looking for here, sir?
我不清楚It's unclear.
可能是个集合点Maybe a rally point of some kind.
长官  你和弗瑞特工Sir, have you and Agent Fury
以前用过这种方式联络吗used this form of communication before?
-从来没有  -那你怎么确定...- Never.  -Then how can you be sure that --
-因为他就会这么做  -可能是个陷阱- Because this is how he operates. - Could be a trap.
目前为止  一切都是陷阱  不是吗So far, everything has been a trap. Am I wrong?
这坐标说不定是九头蛇发给你的Hydra could have sent you those coordinates.
尼克·弗瑞Nick Fury...
亲手交给我这个徽章gave me this badge.
他交到我手上时  我发了誓When he did, I swore an oath.
我们都发了誓We all did.
即使大势已去  仍要坚持奋斗To serve when everything else fails,
誓死捍卫人类的最后一道防线to be humanity's last line of defense,
做坚强的盾牌to be the shield.
这组坐标一定是有意义的These coordinates mean something.
我敢肯定I'm certain of it.
这飞机也是弗瑞给我的Fury also gave me this plane.
谁想下去  机舱内有降落伞Anyone wants off, chutes are in the bay.
请自便Help yourself.
我们人数不足We were outnumbered,
并且神盾局占据上风and S.H.I.E.L.D. pressed the advantage.
-可你们还是乘直升机逃出来了  -是的  长官- You managed to make it out with the chopper. - Yes, sir.
算了  立方体监狱不要紧No worries, then. The cube's small potatoes.
等我们攻入冷藏库Once we hit the fridge
拿到藏在里面的各种玩具and grab all the fun toys tucked away inside,
到时攻占任何基地都不在话下we'll be able to take any base we want.
九头蛇万岁Hail hydra!
得了  把手放下吧  卡米斯基All right, all right, put your arms down, Kaminsky.
你这样子活像西德克萨斯的拉拉队员You look like a west Texas cheerleader at a pep rally.
-让我看看那件武器  -是  长官- Let me see that weapon.  - Yes, sir.
把带子收起来Tuck that strap in.
你失望了是吧You were disappointed
他没有千里眼的能力that he wasn't a real clairvoyant.
有个问题我想问你There was a question I would have asked.
你跟他认识很久了吗You've known him a long time?
在我十几岁时就认识了Ever since I was a teenager.
他将我从地狱里拯救出来He pulled me out of a hell.
让我不至于迷失自我Saved me from myself.
现在  你够了解我了吗So, now do you know me?
知道该怎么套我话了You know how to work me?
我只是好奇而已I'm just curious.
如果我真想套你的话If I wanted to work you,
我就会打听关于科尔森和他团队I'd ask you about Coulson and his team
以及你是如何取得他们信任的and how you managed to gain their trust.
我从飞机上跳了下去I jumped out of a plane.
卧底技巧第一招Deep-cover tactics 101 --
尽早表现出大无畏的英勇举动perform selfless acts of bravery early on.
我跳机救回了那个女博士So I jumped to save the scientist.
不过我有降落伞I had a parachute.
梅就没怀疑过吗May never suspected.
梅特工是主要威胁Agent May was the primary threat,
所以我和她走得很近so I let things get intimate.
你不像她喜欢的类型You don't seem like her type.
我是大众情人型I'm everyone's type.
斯凯是个未知数Skye was the unknown variable.
做她的监管人员  她就会向我倾诉Being her S.O. put me in a position to be a sounding board,
让我了解她的想法get an idea what she was thinking.
科尔森呢And Coulson?
你要求参加的时候他没起疑吗He wasn't skeptical when you pressured him to join?
他要求的我He pressured me.
你越是不想加入进去You'd be surprised how often you get invited to the party
就越有人来拉你when you don't want to go.
长官  我当初受训就是做行动专家"Sir, I was trained from day one as a specialist.
我单打独斗  把事办好"I go in alone, I get it done.
但是团队合作  我可做不来This team thing -- not my speed."
我装成一个科尔森可以提携帮助的人I gave Coulson a person he thought he could help.
飞机上都是这样的人Plane was full of them.
就这样吗It's that simple?
你对他们真的一点感情都没有You really felt nothing for them.
我接触过科尔森  他是个好人I spent time with Coulson. He's a good man.
愿意为你出生入死Someone who'd lay down his life for you.
这样的人你不欠他的情吗Don't you owe a man like that something?
当然Sure.
但我欠加勒特一切But I owe Garrett everything.
嗯  会很棒的  好了Yeah, it's gonna be great. All right.
你还好吗You okay?
跟你说吧Tell you what,
我们跳过你假装关心我好不好的戏码吧let's skip the part where you act concerned about my well-being.
你想怎样What is it you want?
我得没收你的武器I need to confiscate your weapon.
能告诉我你是哪根筋搭错了You want to share the twisted logic
才产生这种念头that makes you think that's a possibility?
弗瑞死了Fury's dead.
这很难接受It's hard to accept,
而且我们还没来得及悼念他and we haven't had a chance to grieve.
没必要  我坚信他还活着There's no reason to. I have faith that he's alive.
你的这种感觉That feeling...
坚信他在联系你的想法  菲尔this belief that he is reaching out to you, Phil,
可能不是信念it might not be faith.
可能有别的原因It might be something else.
那是什么And what's that?
九头蛇Hydra.
九头蛇Hydra.
这些想法可能跟关于Impulses implanted in your brain
美丽海岛的记忆  一起植入了你的脑海里right alongside memories of a beautiful island.
是吗Really?
你现在就想来跟我说这个This is what you want to come to me with right now?
根本不可能  弗瑞亲自下的令That's not possible. Fury ordered the surgery.
没错  但塔希提计划并非他亲自负责Yes, but he wasn't in charge of the Tahiti Project,
而真正主导你手术的人也许正是负责...and the person that was behind that operation may be in ch--
慢着  慢着Wait, wait, wait.
你刚说什么What did you say?
幕后还有别人Somebody else was behind it?
-是谁  -我不知道- Who the hell was that? - I don't know.
谁  告诉我Who?! Tell me!
菲尔  我不知道Phil, I don't know.
你不知道You don't know?
让我猜猜Oh. Let me guess.
又只有弗瑞知道Only Fury knows.
没错Yes.
他不说  你不可能知道还有谁负责And without him, there's no way to know who is responsible.
而你的行为真有可能在被九头蛇控制And there's a real danger that Hydra's controlling your actions.
所以弗瑞让我加入进来That's why Fury put me on this plane.
好监视你To watch you.
我不会交出我的武器I'm not gonna hand over my weapon.
你要动手抢吗You want to try to take it from me?
那就好Good.
滚出我的办公室Now get out of my office.
我们得相信科尔森心里有数We have to trust that Coulson knows what he's doing.
-我敬重科尔森  -你该称他科尔森特工- Hey, I respect Coulson. - Agent Coulson to you.
科尔森特工Agent Coulson.
他在中心救了我们He saved our asses back at the hub.
但要我说  这是不会有结果的[追逐白鲸]But I'm telling you, he's chasing the white whale.
得了吧  你读过《白鲸》吗Okay. Have you even read "Moby-dick"?
读过  你呢Yeah. Have you?
关你什么事That's not the point.
麻烦你别再絮叨你的歪理邪说Now if you please stop spouting your nonsense
让我集中精神整理存货and let me get back to checking my inventory.
他也许是对的  菲兹He may be right, Fitz.
科尔森可能不知不觉地把大家领进了陷阱Coulson could be leading us into a trap and not even know it.
整个世界都在分崩离析The whole world's coming apart at the seams.
现在不是盲目行动的时候Now's not the time to follow blindly.
是的No.
这种时候要支持你相信的人It's times like these you stick with the guy you believe in.
冷藏库  地点:保密
这楼有一百层It's a hundred floors.
唯一的入口在屋顶The only way in is through the roof.
请报上姓名  并说明此行目的Identify yourself and state your purpose.
我是格兰特·沃德特工  你们应该认识他Agent Grant Ward. You know who this is.
汉德通报过Hand called it in.
我们接到明确命令  汉德特工不在时We have specific orders not to let anyone in
禁止任何人入内without Agent Hand's presence.
她人呢So where is she?
你认为呢Where do you think she is?
她正前去会见She's heading to meetings with
每一个还活着的神盾局高级特工every high-ranking S.H.I.E.L.D. agent still out there.
战争爆发了  你们不知道吗There's a war going on, in case you guys missed it.
你们真要我用无线电联络她You really want me to radio her,
让她把飞机掉头开回来吗have her turn the plane around, come all the way back?
没错That's exactly what you need to do.
好吧All right.
看来你们是没见识过汉德发火的样子吧I guess you boys have never seen Hand angry, have you?
找掩护Take cover!
是九头蛇It's Hydra!
-把门打开  -这违反规定- Open the door! - It's against protocol!
我不管规定I don't care about your protocol!
把门打开  你们会害死我的Open the door! You're gonna get me killed!
管他呢Screw it.
快进去  快进去Come on! Come on! Come on!
你们这么久才放我们进来Took you boys long enough.
得联络安保Need to radio security.
九头蛇是怎么知道你和汉德要来的How the hell did Hydra know that you and Hand were coming?
我们告诉他们的We told them.
下次事前警告一下A little warning next time.
他们有自动武器啊I mean, they had automatic weapons.
我忍不住  那句台词好赞啊I couldn't resist. It was too good a line.
去血拼吧Let's go shopping.
空气安全Air's clear.
我第一次来是为了关押约翰尼·霍顿First time I came down here was to lock up Johnny Horton.
狮鹫
听过他的大名吗Ever heard of him?
给自己弄了一对狮爪Guy somehow gave himself these lion's paws for hands.
能想象吗Can you imagine?
貌似不太实用啊That doesn't seem practical.
萝卜青菜  各有所爱Everybody's got their own weird thing, I suppose.
到了Here we go.
你知道"弹弓"计划吗You know the Slingshot program?
知道  神盾局解决太过危险的物品的办法Yeah, that's how S.H.I.E.L.D. gets rid of its dangerous technology.
是吗Do they, now?
欢迎来到玩具店Welcome to the Toy Store.
大家听好  能拿多少是多少All right, grab all you can, boys.
看上去有危险  很好If it looks dangerous, good.
外星的  更棒Alien? Even better.
全都在这儿  "弹弓"是个幌子It's all here. Slingshot's a fake.
我们朝太空发射了很多空火箭We shot a lot of empty rockets into space.
也许每隔一段时间And maybe every once in a while,
为了好玩  他们会在里面放只猴子they put a monkey in one for kicks.
你真以为弗瑞会放弃这些好东西吗You really think Fury would give away all these goodies?
这可是We're talking about the same guy
鼓捣宇宙魔方that messed around with tesseract technology
引发了外星人入侵的人and sparked an alien invasion.
找到了There you are.
记得这玩意吗Remember this?
记得Yeah.
在秘鲁找到的I found it in Peru.
好像是等离子体粒子束Some sort of plasma particle beam.
等离子体粒子束  才怪Plasma particle beam, my ass.
在我看来更像是张金卡I look at it more as a gold card.
去坐标位置还要走大约7英里Coordinates are about a 7-mile hike from here.
地形比较险峻  更不用说被白雪覆盖Terrain's pretty rough, even if it wasn't covered with snow.
梅特工和我可以先去探路Agent May and I could lead a scouting party first,
确保这不是陷阱make sure this isn't a trap.
没时间了There's no time.
还有不到八小时In less than eight hours,
北约的卫星将经过我们上方a NATO satellite will pass directly over us.
如果空客还在这儿  就会被发现If the bus is still here, they'll know.
以我的经验  我们绝对不会白跑I've been doing this long enough to know that something's up there.
但这次任务的选择权在于你们But this mission has to be your choice.
最近几天发生了很多事A lot's changed in the last few days.
我知道对我们在做的事I know you all have your doubts
对我  你们都有疑虑about what we've been doing, about me.
可我没有  所以我要去找But I don't, which is why I'm going to find
弗瑞为我们准备的东西whatever Fury has waiting for us...
无论你们参与与否With you or without you.
听见了吧Well, you heard the man.
我们时间不多了We don't have much time.
大家别客气You're welcome, gentlemen!
别忘了追随你的梦想Don't forget to follow your dreams.
女士们Ladies.
这够科尔森忙一阵了This ought to keep Coulson busy a while.
格兰特Grant!
快来Come on!
我们得走了  直升机快满了We got to roll. The chopper's almost full.
就是这儿了There it is.
你在做什么What the hell you doing?
用下行吗You mind?
你最好退后点You might want to take a step back.
我没懂I'm not following.
科尔森说这下面藏了点东西Coulson told me there was a little something hidden down below.
真不想扫你的兴  但这是底层了Hate to tell you, but this is the bottom floor.
我亲眼看过蓝图I've seen the blueprints with my own eyes.
想赌一把吗Care to make it interesting?
输的人请吃晚饭Loser buys dinner.
一言为定Perfect.
我吃飞机餐都快吃吐了I'm so sick of the crap we ate on that plane.
你好啊  美人Well, hello, gorgeous.
这不太妙This is not good.
是不是熊  发现熊了吗Bears. Did it find bears?
没  什么都没找到No. Found nothing.
没有生命迹象  或是神盾局基地No sign of life or S.H.I.E.L.D. base
没发现任何值得我们冻掉屁股的东西or anything making it even remotely worthwhile freezing our butts off.
你之前说的关于科尔森的话  是真心的吗Did you mean what you said earlier about Coulson?
我不知道  珍玛I don't know, Jemma.
我想相信科尔森心里有数  但是I want to believe Coulson knows what he's doing, but...
至少我们还有彼此Well, at least we still have each other.
没错  幸好Yeah. Good.
我最不想的就是改变现状'cause the last thing I want is for things to change.
菲兹Fitz...
已经都变了It's too late for that.
你觉得他还好吗You think he's okay?
这几天挺难熬的It's been a rough couple of days.
我不是这个意思That's not what I meant.
你并不知道弗瑞究竟让我做什么Don't act like you know what Fury had me do.
他让你监视科尔森是有理由的Well, he had you spy on him for a reason.
理由是什么So what was it?
弗瑞担心科尔森会得知真相Fury was concerned about Coulson finding out the truth.
医生觉得那会对他有负面影响The doctors felt it would have negative consequences.
比如什么  发疯吗Like what? Like he'd go crazy?
自燃还是什么的Spontaneously combust or something?
还不清楚It's not clear.
我只知道今天之前  他还一切正常All I know is he seemed stable until today.
现在他把我们带到了无人之地  寻找鬼魂And now he has us in the middle of nowhere, chasing ghosts.
这是因为他的世界崩塌了That's because his whole world fell apart.
崩塌的不只是他一个He's not alone in that.
到了This is it!
这里应该有什么东西There's got to be something here.
保持警戒  注意观察Stay alert. Eyes open.
这附近肯定有什么东西It's got to be here somewhere.
我们要在这里待多久再回去How long should we look before thinking about heading back?
我们不回去We're not going back,
除非找到弗瑞让我们找的东西not until we find whatever Fury has waiting for us.
卫星怎么办What about the satellite?
那没关系It doesn't matter.
空客飞过来已经用完了燃料The bus used all its remaining fuel just to get us here.
你在飞到这荒无人烟的地方之前就知道了吗Did you know this before flying us out into the middle of nowhere?
这是正确的决定It was the right play.
弗瑞发给我们这组坐标是有原因的Fury sent us these coordinates for a reason.
原因是什么And what reason is that?
我不知道  梅  我不知道I don't know, May! I don't know!
肯定有什么东西在这里There's got to be something here!
这是有意义的  一定是有意义的This means something! This has to mean something!
世界需要我们  九头蛇就在外面The world needs us! Hydra is out there!
我们不能让他们取胜We cannot let them win.
不能让他们定义我们是谁We -- we cannot let them define us.
你们懂吗Do you understand that?
我们不是无名特工We are not agents of nothing!
我们是神盾局特工  这个称呼还是有意义的We are agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., and that still carries weight!
一定是有意义的It -- it has to carry weight!
我们经历了那么多  那是有意义的After everything we've been through, that carries weight!
对不起I'm sorry.
-趴下  趴下  -快走- Get down! Get down! - Go, go, go, go, go!
看来我们找到了Well, it seems like we found it!
大家不要动Nobody move!
我觉得这不是个问题I really don't think that's going to be a problem!
这是神盾局的设施This is a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility.
先开枪  再问问题吗Shoot first, ask questions later?
感觉不像神盾局的作风Doesn't sound like S.H.I.E.L.D. to me.
这不是九头蛇  是弗瑞在联络我们It's not Hydra. This is Fury reaching out.
但没办法确定啊There's no way to know that for sure.
有一个办法There's one way.
菲尔  不要Phil, don't!
-别  -菲尔- No. Hey! N-- - Phil!
上报身份Identify yourself.
我是神盾局特工菲尔·科尔森I'm Phil Coulson, agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.

这辈子头一次请别人吃牛排自己还这么开心I've never been so happy to buy a man a steak dinner in my life.
等你接到账单再说吧Wait till you see the bill.
干嘛拉长着脸啊Why the long face?
硬盘出了点问题There's a complication with the hard drive.
我可不喜欢问题I don't like complications.
这和斯凯有关This one involves Skye.
我们找了三个小组侵入硬盘  但她设好程序We had three teams try to hack it, but she programmed it
一旦有外人想要读取  就会自动清除所有资料to erase all data if anyone other than her attempts to access it.
像她的风格Of course she did.
大概是为防止硬盘落入敌手吧In case it fell into the wrong hands, I guess.
你知道该怎么做吧  罗密欧You know what that means, Romeo.
这是什么地方What is this place?
弗瑞的秘密基地之一One of Fury's secret bases.
我管这地方叫天意I call it Providence,
但严格说来它没有名字although technically it doesn't have a name
因为严格来说它并不存在because, technically, it doesn't exist,
因为是个秘密基地it being a secret base and all.
所有人请跟我来If everyone would follow me.
挺不错的吧Pretty cool, huh?
抱歉问一句  你到底是谁I'm sorry. Who are you, exactly?
神盾局六级特工  艾瑞克·凯尼格Eric Koenig, agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., level 6.
菲尔·科尔森Phil coulson.
我知道  久仰了I know. I know.
见到你真是荣幸  科尔森特工It is an honor to meet you, agent Coulson.
刚刚外面的事让你受惊了And I apologize for the kerfuffle outside.
精确遥控系统是用来The precision remote system was designed
摧毁所有快速移动的金属物品的to destroy any rapidly moving metallic object.
那可是我的徽章It was my badge.
那...确实很难替换It was -- okay. That's gonna be... tough to replace,
但用不了多久  你就会有自己的胸卡了but very soon, you're gonna be issued your very own lanyard.
其他人的胸卡也会据情况逐一分发Lanyards for others will be distributed on a case-by-case basis.
弗瑞局长怎么样了What happened to director Fury?
他还活着吗Is he alive?
弗瑞...没能活着出特区  这很难接受Fury... didn't make it out of D.C. It's been rough.
我们都挺震惊的We're all a little shaken up,
而且现在冷藏库也沦陷了especially now that the Fridge has fallen.
她要给谁打电话Who is she calling?
我们有个队友去冷藏库了We had a man at the Fridge.
沃德  谢天谢地Ward? Oh, thank god.
能私下和你谈谈吗Can I speak to you in private?
有人来真好It's nice having company.
别误会  不是说这地方不好But don't get me wrong. I mean, this place is great.
这些窗子是怎么回事What's with the windows?
是想让与世隔绝好受一些Oh, that's supposed to make the isolation more bearable.
每周七天  天天换景色Every day of the week, different view.
如果你喜欢裸体海滩  周三有眼福了Wednesday's pretty terrific if you like topless beaches.
那你在这儿多久了So, how long have you been in here?
奇塔瑞人入侵纽约之后就在了Since the Chitauri invaded New York.
其实也没那么糟Oh, it's not so bad.
看成堆的历史小说Reading a ton of historical fiction,
和我哥网上对战Gaming online with my brother.
我们《使命召唤》打得可好了We're racking up major "Call Of Duty" hours.
你玩吗You play?
当然  但最近没怎么玩Of course. Lately, not so much.
你想告诉我什么吗So, was there something you wanted to tell me?
对  差点忘了  弗瑞没死Yes! My bad. Fury is not dead.
什么What?
嗯  九头蛇以为杀死了他Yeah, the -- hydra thinks they killed him,
但他设法逃出了华盛顿特区but he managed to escape from D.C.
那你刚刚骗了我的队员So you just lied to my team.
我又不了解他们  这是弗瑞亲自下的命令Well, I don't know them. And those are Fury's direct orders.
只能让少数几个人知道他还活着Only a select few people can know that he's alive --
玛丽亚·希尔  美国队长  另外几个人和你我Maria Hill, Cap, a couple of others, and now you and me.
他现在在哪Where is he now?
没人知道No one knows.
他消失后就没人有他的消息了Ever since he went dark, no one's heard from him.
这是最高机密  绝对保密预案This is highest priority, full eclipse protocol.
其他人都不能知道No one else can know.
我不想对我的队员有所隐瞒I'm not comfortable keeping secrets from my team.
他们还没经过审查Well, they haven't been vetted.
如果你对他们透露  就会有很大麻烦And if you talk, we're gonna have a major problem.
你是在威胁我吗Are you threatening me?
绝对是  弗瑞的命令100%. Fury's orders.
他不大信任人  是吧Not big on the trust, is he?
说清了吗So we're good?
说清了We're good.
太棒了Great!
我给你发胸卡I'm gonna get you set up with a lanyard.
你让梅特工把飞机开进来吧Uh, maybe ask Agent May to pull the plane in.
我这儿有停机坪什么的I've got a parking space for her and everything.
好吧  回头见All right. See you soon.
秘密基地Secret base, huh?
正是弗瑞的作风Sounds just like Fury.
斯凯确认了  弗瑞死了Skye confirmed. Fury's out of the picture.
这真是好消息Well, that is good news.
让我们少操心一件事Gives us one less thing to worry about.
关于那个姑娘Listen, about the girl --
我知道那对你意义重大Look, I know how much it means to you.
我会办好的I'll get it done.
我们都有弱点Hey, we all have our weaknesses.
心性使然  无道理可言The heart wants what it wants.
不能控制一切Can't control everything.
如果你能不暴露身份就办到So, if you can do it the easy way without blowing your cover,
那就请便吧then by all means.
我只需要和她独处一会儿  得到情报I just need some time alone with her to get the information.
你会得到的  科尔森会很忙You'll have it. Coulson will be busy.
我给你24小时拿到密码  然后离开I'll give you 24 hours to get the password and get out.
那之后After that, well...
除掉他们  带那姑娘来见我cross off the team and bring the girl to me.
你编好故事了吗You got your story straight?

欢迎  沃德特工  我们正在等你Welcome, Agent Ward. We've been expecting you.
我还以为你指错路了呢Thought you might have given me bad directions.
至少机关枪没向你扫射At least the machine gun didn't start shooting at you.
你没事吧You okay?
只是擦伤It's just a scratch.
也许断了一两根肋骨Maybe a broken rib or two.
来吧Come on.
西蒙斯该给你检查下Simmons should take a look at you.
然后也许我们能喝一杯Then maybe we can get that drink.
好啊Deal.
漫威《神盾局特工》马上回来"Marvel's agents of S.H.I.E.L.D." will return in a moment.
你  你肯定在逗我吧You. You have to be kidding me.
我一直待在一个比我鞋柜还小的牢房里I've been in a cell smaller than my shoe closet.
都不能用叉子吃东西I wasn't allowed to eat with a fork,
这就够糟了which would have been worse
更糟的是我只能吃烘肉卷if I'd been allowed to eat anything but meatloaf!
我刚把你救出来I did just bust you out.
是啊  但当初是你把我关进去的Yeah, out of a prison you put me in!
你知道我遇见你之前过得怎么样吗Do you know what my life was like before I met you?
真的很棒It was really nice.
但因为你  我的资产被冻结了But because of you, I've had my assets frozen,
我遭到了毒打I've been beaten.
你差点把我的舌头扯掉了You almost ripped my tongue out of my mouth!
但我没有  我现在后悔了But I didn't. I'm regretting that now.
是啊  受这么多苦就为个冒牌货Yeah. And all that for a fake.
蕾娜告诉了我"千里眼"的真相Raina here, she told me the truth about "the clairvoyant."
他比较难以接受He didn't respond well.
我信了  那怪我Hey, I bought it. That's on me.
但你要是觉得我还会再帮你  你就是疯了But you're crazy if you think I'm gonna do another damn thing for you.
你没告诉他吗You didn't tell him?
不想毁掉惊喜Didn't want to spoil the surprise.
我的确没有天赋  奎恩It's true I'm not gifted, Quinn.
不过我为你准备了一份But that doesn't mean I don't have a special gift
特别的礼物just for you.
我的重力鎓My gravitonium.
你就想说这个吗That's all you've got to say?
谢谢Thank you.
这才像话That's more like it.
