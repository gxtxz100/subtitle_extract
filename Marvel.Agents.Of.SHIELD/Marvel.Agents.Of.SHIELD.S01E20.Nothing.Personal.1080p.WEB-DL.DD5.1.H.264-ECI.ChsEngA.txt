漫威《神盾局特工》前情回顾Previously on "Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."...
-硬盘  -是我们团队所有的研究- A hard drive? - It's all the research our team's ever done,
为了安全加了密encrypted for safekeeping.
我给你24小时拿到密码  然后离开I'll give you 24 hours to get the password and get out.
那之后  带那姑娘来见我 After that, bring the girl to me.
你不用这样拒人于千里之外You don't have to shut people out.
不  我得这样Yeah, I do.
埃里克Eric.
有些关于我的事...There are things about me...
你知道了肯定不会喜欢that you wouldn't like if you knew.
他是九头蛇He's Hydra.
你还好吗You all right?
为什么乱跑Why did you leave?
现在好了I'm good.
这是我想要的I want this.
刚收到菲兹的消息  我们必须马上走I just got word from Fitz. We need to go right now.
我们的空客呢Where's our bus?
-还有队员呢  -不知道啊- And our team? - I don't know.
华盛顿特区
是的  一如预料的那样Yeah, it went as expected.
神盾局垮了  所有人都想要答案S.H.I.E.L.D. implodes, and everyone wants answers.
中情局  国安局  国家侦察局  我都能应付The CIA, NSA, NRO -- them I can handle.
但是国会  国会就像是幼儿园But congress? Congress is like kindergarten.
冷藏库在哪  那里有什么"Where is this Fridge?" "What was in there?"
类人体是谁或是什么东西"Who or what is a man-thing?"
我现在真需要鸡尾酒和额叶切除术I swear I need a cocktail and a lobotomy.
司法部
但显然  他们依然对我的一举一动十分好奇But apparently, my every move continues to fascinate them.
今晚的标准监控套餐包括Tonight's standard-issue surveillance package includes
假冒的雅痞fake yuppie
公交站不看短信的女子not checking her texts at the bus stop,
假扮的流浪汉  略显冒犯imposter homeless man -- mildly offensive --
跟着我的潮男看着眼熟And the hipster following me looks familiar.
他好像是俄罗斯人I think he's Russian or...
不见了gone.
小辣椒  我十分钟后打给你Pepper, I'll call you back in 10.
我们需要谈谈  希尔特工We need to talk, Agent Hill.
梅May.
打个电话不就行了A phone call would have done it.
不过多谢你的谨慎But I appreciate the discretion.
我想或许你会喜欢自由一晚Thought you'd like the night off.
你答应为斯塔克工作一定把他们气疯了They must hate that you're going to work for Stark.
大多数情报组织Most of the intelligence community
都恨不得把我丢进黑洞would like to drop me into a dark hole,
但即使是他们也不敢惹托尼的律师军团but even they can't mess with Tony's army of lawyers.
所以  现在  我们只好把全球安全私有化了So, for now, we're privatizing global security.
-要加入吗  -科尔森需要帮助- Want to join? - Coulson needs help.
他不愿再接受我的帮助了And he won't take it from me anymore.
他在哪Where is he?
天意秘密基地Providence base.
他已经有够多的麻烦了And he's got enough to worry about
却还执念于塔希提计划without obsessing over T.A.H.I.T.I.
一心要查出是谁掩盖了它and who covered it up.
你是说除了我们You mean besides us.
他知道多少了How much does he know?
够多了Enough.
知道他们用了外星生物科技  改写了他的记忆That they used alien biology, rewrote his memories,
还知道弗瑞是在他人指引下干的and that Fury did it under someone else's direction.
我想知道是谁I want to know who that was.
你担心是亚历山大·皮尔斯You're afraid it was Alexander Pierce.
皮尔斯部长原本是负责人Secretary Pierce was the man in charge --
弗瑞只会听他的命令  而他是九头蛇The only person Fury took orders from -- and he was hydra.
让那样的人给你洗脑Having a man like that design your brain?
你能明白我为什么担忧You can understand my concern.
弗瑞接受的命令来自高层Fury took his cues from pretty high up.
这我知道That much I know.
但我问他是谁下令的时But when I asked him who it was,
弗瑞说他决定不埋葬科尔森时Fury said that he buried that intel
埋葬了那份情报when he decided not to bury coulson.
玛丽亚  现在不是耍嘴皮子的时候Maria, this is not the time to wax poetic.
他的原话  不是我的Those are his words, not mine.
你知道的  他有时说话爱绕弯You knew the man. Sometimes he spoke in riddles.
那只能靠我自己弄明白了Guess I'll have to solve it, then.
除非你愿意替我问问弗瑞Unless you want to ask Fury for me.
弗瑞死了Fury's dead.
我只相信眼见为实I'll believe it when I see it.
放下武器Drop your weapon!
3分钟20秒  不是吧你们3 minutes and 20 seconds. Really?
你们要是我的手下  那就等着被炒吧If you were my agents, it wouldn't be for long.
弗瑞秘密基地  天意
再放一遍Play it again.
再放也是一样的  长官It's the same every time, sir.
菲兹Fitz.
如我所说  所有内部监控录像都被删除As I said, all internal camera feeds were erased,
但机库降落辅助系统是分开的but the hangar's landing assist system is separate.
摄像机跟踪动作The camera tracks movement.
所以我们走后  一切正常  直到这里So, after we left, everything's normal until this.
出入记录显示梅在几分钟后An entry log has may leaving the base
从前门离开了基地  就她一人a few minutes later through the front door -- only her.
然后是这个And then this.
他们握着手Holding hands.
之后飞机起飞了Soon after, the plane takes off.
只有这么多图像But that is all we've got.
他们去哪了  凯尼格呢Where are they going? And Koenig?
凯尼格肯定不知怎么上了飞机Koenig must have gotten onto the plane somehow.
没有别的进出通道There's no other way in or out.
防护门和机库大门是唯一出口The blast door and the hangar door are the only exits.
均未受损And both are undamaged.
所以没有人入侵  他们也不是逃难So nobody attacked the place, and they weren't running away.
-那是为什么呢  -也许凯尼格收到了命令- So why? - Maybe Koenig got orders.
从谁那里  肯定不是弗瑞From who? Not Fury.
现在还有谁能发号施令吗Is there anyone left to give orders?
我们现在不是处于随机应变的状态吗Aren't we just improvising at this point?
那也无法解释为什么通讯线路被切断Still wouldn't explain why the communication lines were cut
为什么他们不带电话  还有梅为什么走or why they left their phones or why May just...Left.
梅离开是我因为我说的话May walked away because I told her to.
我很生气  说了一些刻薄的话I was mad, and I was mean.
那我们就不需要她了Then we don't need her sorry ass.
你说什么Excuse me?
就我们现在的处境而言With all the crap we're facing,
现在不是撒手不管的好时机this is not the time to pull the ripcord, bail out.
我去给大家准备点吃的  我们总要吃饭I'll make us some food. We have to eat.
我帮你Let me help.
不用了  我来吧  你待在这里Uh, no, I'll get it, actually. You stay here.
西蒙斯Simmons.
之前执行任务时For a minute there in the field,
我还觉得一切都恢复了正常  但结果...I thought things were normal again, and then...
你说他们为什么会不辞而别呢Why do you think they left us in the dark?
我不知道I don't know.
但总会搞明白的  我们需要保持积极的心态But something will turn up. We just have to stay positive.
为了科尔森  他确实很不容易For Coulson, yeah. I know. He's had a rough go of it.
是啊Yeah.
先是加勒特和梅  又见到奥黛丽Between Garrett and May and seeing Audrey and...
煎薄饼pancakes.
科尔森还为煎薄饼伤心吗Coulson's upset about pancakes now?
那是个能让人开心的东西  不是吗That's one way to cheer everyone up a bit, don't you think?
我去找找看我们有没有库存I'll see if we have any in stock.
好  我去加热煎锅Yeah, I'll fire up the griddle.
夜晚Night?
白天Day?
长官  你是数据分析专家Sir, you're an expert on analysis.
我看得出你正在考虑各种可能情况I can see you running scenarios in your head,
有什么想法吗so what do you got?
最好的情况是Best case --
凯尼格特工知道一些我们不知道的事Agent Koenig knows something we don't.
他带走了一支小队He took a team,
出于安全考虑没有告诉我们kept us in the dark for our safety.
那最坏的情况呢Worst-case scenario?
我们之中一直有内奸We've had a wolf in the herd the whole time.
沃德是九头蛇
菲兹都把糖果藏在床底下Fitz keeps the candy under his bunk.
你在找什么What are you up to?
只是想找个卫星电话打给其他队员Just looking for the sat-phone to call the team,
确保大家都没事  没人被炸飞make sure everyone's all right, no one's blown up.
我有电话I've got the phone.
我刚刚和科尔森通过话I just talked to Coulson a little while ago.
-真的吗  -是的  对不起- You did? - Yeah, sorry.
应该告诉你的Should have told you.
他们都很好  我们越快到达指定地点They're okay, but the sooner we get to the location,
解密硬盘decrypt that drive...
就能越快与队伍汇合The sooner we can rendezvous with the team.
说得对Exactly.
当时觉得定位加密硬盘很明智Seemed like a smart play at the time, geo-locking the drive.
我没想到会连累我们自己I didn't think it would backfire on us.
这不叫连累It hasn't backfired.
硬盘本就该做到无法破解The drive is supposed to be impossible to crack.
不过这个坐标很特别啊Pretty specific coordinates, though.
你可以选择世上任何一个地方You could have picked anywhere in the world.
为什么是个洛杉矶的餐厅Why a random diner in L.A.?
坐标早就内建在加密方式里了It was already built into my encryption.
一直没变过  但也挺合适的Never changed it. But it's fitting.
那是我遇见麦克·彼得森的地方It's where I met Mike Peterson.
是这趟神盾局过山车启程的地方It's where this whole S.H.I.E.L.D. roller coaster started.
而且  从战术角度看  你会如何选接头点Plus, tactically, what do you look for in a dropsite?
公众场所  人员密集  多出口Public place, lots of people, multiple exits.
是啊  如果遇到了麻烦那儿比较安全Yep. Figured if I ever got in trouble, I'd be safe there.
你会很安全的Oh, you'll be plenty safe.
但这个  并不是解决之道This, however, is not the answer.
怎么了  女孩子就不能保护自己吗What's the matter? A girl can't defend herself?
目前情况下  我们最要不得的In this situation, the last thing we can afford
就是因藏匿武器而被抓is to get pinched on a concealed-weapons charge.
你又说对了You're right. Again.
反正也找不到子弹Couldn't find any rounds anyway.
我们会没事的We are gonna be okay.
我答应你  直到这事结束之前I promise, until this thing is over,
我都不会让你离开我的视线I'm not gonna let you out of my sight.
不可能  这不可能Impossible. It can't be.
不  不  我不相信No. No. I-I don't believe it.
深呼吸  菲兹特工Take a breath, Agent Fitz.
别让我深呼吸Don't tell me to take a breath.
你到底是谁  我说真的Who the hell are you? I mean, really. Come on.
我根本都不了解你I don't even know who you are.
-我也刚经历过这种事  记得吗  -别碰我- I just went through this, remember? - Don't touch me.
我的监管人员也是个满嘴谎话的...My S.O. turned out to be a lying son of a --
但沃德不是  沃德不会Well, not Ward. Okay? Not ward.
你知道为什么吗  因为他是我们的朋友Do you know why? Because he's our friend.
西蒙斯一定会找到线索的And Simmons will find something.
告诉他啊  珍玛Go ahead. Tell him, Jemma.
让我专心工作  菲兹Let me work, Fitz.
你先告诉他沃德不是Yeah, but tell him that Ward isn't --
让我专心工作Let me work.
一定有别的原因  长官  你仔细想想Something else is at play here, sir. Think about it.
他们只是想混淆视听They're just trying to mess with our heads.
他们在墙上写那些就是想吓唬我们They wrote that on the wall to scare us.
-按部就班进的来  -我们得离开这里- One step at a time. - We need to get out of here.
下一步是西蒙斯给出她的报告Simmons will give her report. That's the next step.
他大约十小时前死于窒息He died approximately 10 hours ago of asphyxiation --
在梅离开之后after May left the premises.
凶器是一根细线A thin wire was used to strangle him.
他的气管被压迫  部分被割穿His trachea is crushed, partially sliced through,
可见凶手下手匆忙So it was done in a hurry.
鉴于撕裂伤的角度Based on the angle of the lacerations,
凶手至少一米九  并且强壮到the killer was at least 6'2" and strong enough to...
能把他抬起...lift him into...
是沃德干的Ward did this.
菲兹Fitz.
别这样No, no, no.
好了  够了Okay! Okay!
我们必须振作一点We need to hold it together.
听着Listen...
再多的愤怒...All that anger,
再多的痛苦all that pain,
你都必须克制  要集中精力找到斯凯you need to hold it in and focus it on Skye.
她还活着She's alive.
她明知道人是沃德杀的And she just walked out of here hand in hand
还和他牵着手走出去with someone she knows is a murderer
因为她在骗他because she's playing him --
就像沃德骗我们一样just like he played us.
菲兹Fitz, Fitz...
我们得修好通讯系统we have to fix the communications.
我们得找到那架飞机We have to track that plane.
你能做到吗Can you do that?
很好Good.
以我对斯凯的了解  她一定有计划的If I know Skye, she's got a plan.
我们得趁沃德发现前And we're gonna find her
找到她before Ward figures out what that is.
斯凯啊  你到底有什么计划Come on, Skye. What's your play?
我都记不得上一次坐在餐馆里是什么时候了I can't remember the last time I sat in a restaurant.
是啊  一直都吃地铁  地道和飞机餐I know. It's been all tubes, tunnels, and plane food.
说不定我还能点个馅饼当甜点呢Maybe I will get pie for dessert.
甜点Dessert?
我还以为一杯咖啡的工夫就能完事了I was hoping we'd be done by the time I finished coffee.
你知道破解这硬盘需要多长时间吗Do you have any idea how long it'll take to decrypt this drive?
你的话  大概十分钟吧For you? I figured 10 minutes.
怎么可能Not even close.
GPS就要花不少时间来校准The GPS will take a hot second to calibrate,
而且我用的是笔记本电脑but I'm working on a laptop.
所以即使每字节三个循环So even at three cycles per byte,
那太字节的数据就要...there are still terabytes of data --
别说细节了  告诉我时间Spare me the details. Give me the timeframe.
一小时能破解就算是奇迹了An hour would be a miracle.
科尔森要的很急Coulson needs this yesterday.
我的笔记本又不是时光机  沃德My laptop's not a time machine, Ward.
这种事急不来That's the science.
看来我们要吃甜点了Guess we're having dessert.
能给我拿根电缆吗  抽屉里应该有一根Can you grab me a cable? Think there's one in the drawer.
多谢Thanks.
好像管用That seemed to work.
菲兹在用喷气机的继电器给它功能Fitz is using the jump jet's relay to power it.
他在这方面简直是天才He's like a ninja with this crap.
-他怎么样  -被吓坏了- How's he doing? - Freaking out.
但集中注意力完成任务是个好方法  你怎么样But focused on the task, which was good advice. And you?
相信我  我会留到以后一起爆发的Trust me, I'm gonna have a major freak out later.
好了All right.
沃德是九头蛇的人Ward is hydra.
你知道这意味着什么吧You know what that means.
加勒特还活着Garrett is alive.
-而汉德特工死了  -是他们袭击了冷藏库- And Agent Hand is dead. - So they hit the fridge.
那么他们就得到了想要的所有武器It means they've got all the weapons they could possibly want.
而我们对此毫不知情And we didn't have a clue.
为什么还要冒险回来呢So why risk coming back here?
而且不是为了除掉我们It wasn't to cross us off.
他想从你这里得到什么What do you have that he wants?
我不知道I don't know.
我们所有情报都在那个硬盘上了He had all our intel on that drive.
他只需要复制一份All he had to do was make a cop--
他回来是为了斯凯He came back for Skye.
她肯定加密了硬盘She must have encrypted that drive,
而只有她才能破解硬盘and she was the only one who could crack back into it.
所以他们不会杀她So they have to keep her alive.
她可以拖延时间And she can stall for time.
我们的飞机在洛杉矶Our plane is in Los Angeles.
终于来了点好消息Finally, some good news.
周边防御已激活Perimeter defenses activated.
警报  敌人逼近警报
话真不该说太早I should have knocked on wood just then.
地面多处有交火Multiple contacts on the ground.
-他们触发了枪塔攻击  -走吧- They just triggered the gun turrets. - Come on.
你又在盯着我看You're staring again.
我不能这么做吗I'm not allowed to do that?
我告诉过你了  破解硬盘很复杂I told you, it's a complicated hack.
你错把我的钦佩当成了不耐烦You've mistaken my admiration for impatience.
不  你就是不耐烦No, it's impatience.
好吧  是我不对  我没想给你压力Okay. Sorry. Didn't mean to stress you out.
也许你该去外面Maybe you should duck outside.
再试试用卫星电话确认一下Try again on the sat-phone just to make sure.
不No.
我们按原计划一起行动We stick together and we stick to the plan.
你越早破解这硬盘The sooner you decrypt this hard drive...
我们就能越早跟他们汇合The sooner we get to them.
你之前就说过了I heard you twice the first time.
地址无效  拒绝访问
你还好吗Are you all right?
你看起来很紧张You look nervous.
你怎么知道  超级间谍How can you tell, superspy?
坐得格外笔直  以免显露你的不安Staying unnaturally still to keep from fidgeting,
保持眼神接触让人觉得你有自信maintaining eye contact to give the impression of confidence.
怎么了What's wrong?
搜索
我上一次坐在这个卡座时The last time I was in this booth,
我对面是麦克·彼得森I was sitting across from Mike Peterson --
那时他是个好人  但现在却成了凶手a good man, and now he's a murderer.
而我们成了联调局的头号通缉犯And we are FBI's most wanted.
仿佛只要一瞬间It's just like any moment,
事态便会急转直下something could go horribly wrong.
放松  你做的很好Relax. You're doing great.
隐藏我的想法和感受Hiding what I'm thinking and feeling --
可不像对你来说那么容易it doesn't come as easy for me as it does for you.
没错  那需要经验Well, it comes with experience.
是啊  我想是这样Yeah, I guess it does.
真希望这个地堡里能再有个地堡I wish this bunker had a bunker.
这些门很结实These doors should hold.
用大炮都不一定轰得开It'll take some major artillery to make a dent.
机库门解锁Hangar door deactivated.
怎么回事  不可能How?! That's impossible!
找掩护Take cover.
快走Let's go.
不是九头蛇It's not Hydra.
是特种部队It's special forces.
我代表美国武装部队On behalf of the United States armed forces,
命令你们投降I order you to stand down.
我重复一遍I repeat,
快投降stand down.
塔伯特上校Colonel Talbot?
你肯定还有比追捕四个神盾局特工There have to be better things for you to do
更重要的事吧than chase four S.H.I.E.L.D. agents.
追你到这该死的苔原之前我就不喜欢你  科尔森I wasn't a huge fan before chasing you to the damn tundra, Coulson.
别挑战我的耐心I wouldn't push it.
你亲自出马我倍感荣幸I'm flattered you came in person.
弗瑞在北美的秘密基地Fury's private base on North American soil?
我一定要亲眼看看I just had to see it for myself.
如果我出来  你会对我开枪吗If I come out, will you shoot me?
那样的话我就不出来了'cause then I won't come out.
别开枪  士兵们Hold your fire, soldiers.
这是世界上最机密的设施之一  上校This is one of the most classified facilities on the planet, Colonel.
你是怎么发现的How the hell did you find it?
我告诉他们的I told them.
节哀顺变My condolences.
菲利普·科尔森
十级机密通话塔希提计划负责人致弗瑞局长最终报告
十级机密"Classified level 10.
塔希提计划负责人致弗瑞局长T.A.H.I.T.I. Project supervisor to Director Fury."
播放
我们不是罪犯We're not criminals.
很好Great.
那我们就把你们都抓起来  让你们好好说说Then we'll take you in, and you can tell us all about it.
你们至少是潜逃了At the very least, you're fugitives.
而逃跑就让你们有了一丝有罪的嫌疑And running away puts a bit of a guilty stink on it,
你们说呢don't you think?
我们不是九头蛇We're not Hydra.
我们是神盾局特工We're agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.
现在  在其他人眼里  那是一码事Well, right now to the rest of the world, that's the same thing.
好吧All right,
我们这么办吧I'm gonna tell you how it's gonna be.
你们给我有用的情报You give me actionable intelligence
我就缩短你们的服刑时间and I'll allow you to serve time awarded.
你们其他的选择Your other options are...
可糟透了pretty much hell.
放马过来吧Do your worst.
我们已经跟你说了一个九头蛇特工了We have told you of a known Hydra agent.
他正在逃跑  而你却在这里威胁我们He's getting away, and your little intimidation speech
让我们没法去救一个特工is keeping us from saving the life of a fellow agent --
一个朋友a friend.
妹子  我这根本不算威胁Sister, you haven't seen intimidation.
现在我是你唯一的朋友And right now I'm you're only friend.
我要是你就小心点别惹火我I'd be careful not to piss me off.
说"特工"表示你们腐败的机构依然存在The word "Agent" implies that your corrupt organization still exists.
你们的领导抛弃了你们转投私营企业Your leadership abandoned you for the private sector,
我们决定默许了and we're gonna allow that
以换来你们这样有价值的人才in exchange for valuable assets like yourself.
所以你们现在应该好好想想So right now I'd be thinking hard and fast
怎么才能让自己有价值about exactly what it is that makes you valuable.
我是给你提供了救命稻草  科尔森I am offering you a lifeline here, Coulson.
不用谢我Don't thank me.
好好配合  我们就不再来打扰你们Just take it, and we'll be on our way.
我没觉得应该谢谢你Don't see how thanks are in order,
毕竟你刚刚出卖了我considering you just sold me out
还领着美军冲进了弗瑞的秘密基地and led the U.S. Military straight to Fury's secret base.
不  菲尔No, Phil.
你带领我们找到了弗瑞的秘密基地You led us straight to Fury's secret base
这是我们之前协议的一部分as part of the deal we made.
你在开玩笑吧You can't be serious.
你和我要把这个废弃的地方You and I are gonna turn over these abandoned tunnels
交给美国政府to the U.S. Government,
他们会很高兴能拿下who will be ever so grateful to take possession
自家后院里的敌方大本营of an enemy stronghold in their backyard.
那我的队员呢What about my team?
他们得走程序Well, they're gonna have to go through the system --
-审讯  -不可能- Interrogations -- - Not gonna happen.
去跟塔伯特谈Look, talk to Talbot.
告诉他一些关于这里无关紧要的情报Cough up some meaningless intel about this place --
当然别说什么重要的Nothing significant, of course,
不要提及神盾局的其他设施nothing about S.H.I.E.L.D.'s other installations.
你还在保护你的秘密You're still protecting your secrets.
有什么特定的事你不想我说出去吗Is there anything specific you're afraid I'll talk about?
比如塔希提计划T.A.H.I.T.I. maybe?
-菲尔  -我构成威胁了- Phil. - I'm a liability.
-是这样吗  -别闹了  菲尔- Is that it? - Grow up, Phil.
你当然有威胁性Of course you're a liability.
但我知道你会做出正确的决定But I know you'll do the right thing.
正确的决定The right thing?
从你嘴里说出来真是可笑That's funny coming from you.
你和弗瑞做出了那种事After everything you and Fury have done?
听着  那是为了你好Look, it was for your own good.
为我好  我懂  我明白For my own good. I know. I get it.
你该告诉我真相的You should have been straight with me.
我会誓死守卫你的秘密I would have kept your secrets like a good soldier.
我一向如此I always have.
可你费心防着我But instead, you were worried about me
却没去防该防的人when you should have been worried about anyone else.
你说得对You're right.
九头蛇的事我们本该料到We should have seen Hydra coming.
但特区一战后  他们已经大势已去But after D.C., they don't stand a chance.
约翰·加勒特还没完蛋John Garrett does.
加勒特  我听说沃德已经解决了他Garrett? I heard Ward took care of him.
沃德是他的秘密武器Ward's his secret weapon.
他杀了维多利亚·汉德  洗劫了冷藏库He killed Victoria Hand, then raided the Fridge,
如今还带走了斯凯  我们正要去找她and now he's got Skye, which is where we were headed
你却卖友求荣  打乱了我们的计划until you so rudely interrupted to sweeten your deal.
沃德是我审查的I vetted Ward.
你想将功赎过吗  别浪费时间了You want to make this right? Stop wasting time.
我们能进行下一步了吗Can we move this along?
我们要彻查这里I'd like to tear this room apart.
当然  上校  请随意Sure, colonel. Knock yourself out.
-去叫你的人  我们该走了  -我们- Get your people. We need to move. - "We"?
还要多久How much longer?
半个小时Half-hour.
你半个小时前就是这么说的You said that a half an hour ago.
不是你让我别紧张的吗Weren't you the one who told me to relax?
那边的警察一直在看我们Those cops over there keep looking at us.
他们只是在打量女服务员罢了They're just checking out the waitress.
他们又不知道你正在假扮成别人They don't know you're pretending to be someone you're not.
是吗  好吧Yeah, all right.
我在假扮谁Who am I pretending to be?
我急躁的男友My impatient boyfriend.
我喜欢这个身份I like that cover.
你最长的卧底任务时间是多久What's the longest you've been undercover?
很深入的那种Like, deep undercover?
16个月Uh, 16 months.
什么时候的事When was that?
学院毕业后第五年吧Mm, about five years outside of the academy.
我伪装成一名俄国驻华沙大使馆的专员I posed as a Russian attache at the embassy in Warsaw.
那一定很辛苦  过着那种双重生活That's got to be so hard, living a double life like that --
刻意接近别人  只为有一日背叛他们Getting close to people, only to turn on them.
真不知道加勒特是怎么做到的I don't know how Garrett did it.
加勒特Garrett?
他做你的监管人员那么久Think about all that time he spent as your S.O. --
慢慢了解你  成为你的导师Getting to know you, being your mentor --
却一直在欺骗你  背叛你only to lie to your face, betray you like that.
这确实很难接受It was, uh, difficult to accept.
庆幸的是  那些都过去了But thankfully, that's over.
因为你解决了他Because you took care of him.
我们能不现在讨论这个吗Can we not discuss this right now?
如果你对他后脑开枪前If you had one more moment before you shot him
还有那么一点时间in the back of the head so heroically,
如果他正坐在这儿If he was sitting right here
-你能对他说任何话  你会说什么  -斯凯- and you could say anything you want, what would you say? - Skye.
你会说他很恶心吗Would you say he's disgusting?
你会跟他说他是个恶心的Would you tell him he's a disgusting,
背后捅刀的叛徒吗backstabbing traitor?
还是去死吧Or to rot in hell?
你在做什么What are you doing?
我只是想跟你诚实地聊一次I'm just trying to have an honest conversation for once.
他们在疏散人群  我们该走了They're starting to clear people out. We should go.
不了  我在这儿就好No, I think I'm good here.
斯凯  我们暴露了  快走吧Skye, we've been made. Come on.
不No.
应急调度系统
通缉逃犯
是我报的警I tipped them off.
九头蛇万岁Hail Hydra.
你们两个  举起双手  快点You two, show me your hands! Now!
-让他们起来  -走出卡座  慢点- Get them up. - Out of the booth, nice and slow.
转过身去All right, turn around.
-双手放在脑上  -小心点  他有武器- Hands on your head. - Just be careful. He's armed.
斯凯Skye!
警官  我投降  逮捕我Officers, I surrender! Arrest me.
慢点  女士  你在说些什么Slow down, ma'am. What are you talking about?
我是神盾局特工No, no. I am an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.,
是通缉逃犯  抓我吧a wanted fugitive. Take me in.
快点  干什么呢  快带我走Come on! What are you doing?! Get me out of here!
你被捕了That's it! Come on.
-我愿意做任何...  -斯凯I'll do whatever you... - Skye.
斯凯Skye!
别跑Don't run.
你不明白You don't understand!
我不是想伤害你I'm not trying to hurt you!
你该谢谢我  是我帮了你You should be thanking me. I saved your ass.
你这根本不是帮我You didn't save my ass.
你把这事弄得人尽皆知了You turned it into a public spectacle.
你让她占了便宜You let her get one over on you.
这正是加勒特担心的That's exactly what Garrett was afraid of.
加勒特不是命令你不准出现吗And Garrett told you to stay out of sight.
他吩咐我暗中跟随你He ordered me to shadow you.
他知道你对斯凯有恻隐之心He knew you had a soft spot for Skye
她可能会利用这一点and she might take advantage of it.
那他就错了Well, he was wrong.
她在我们手上We have her.
只要她告诉我们地点  就万事大吉了And once she gives us a location, we'll be off.
你们做梦去吧Yeah, that's not gonna happen.
你先回避一下  我来搞定她Take a walk. I can handle this.
你能吗  到现在你也没搞定Can you? You haven't so far.
加勒特说你只有五分钟Garrett says you have five minutes.
我能解释的I can explain.
你个骗子  混蛋  去死吧你Lying bastard! Son of a bitch! You lying --
别打了  停下Stop. Stop!
冷静点Calm down.
消停点吧  结束了  你输定了Okay? Okay? It's over. You can't win.
明白吗Okay?
够了Stop.
相处了这么久All this time,
一起经历了那么多  为什么everything we've been through -- why?
你怎么能背叛我们How could you?
我是在执行任务  与个人情感无关I was on a mission. It wasn't personal.
"与个人..."  你这叫什么话"It was--" You did not just say that.
与个人情感无关吗"It wasn't personal"?!
斯凯  听我说Skye, listen to me.
天啊  我差点就信了God, I might actually believe that.
你  那是纳粹招人的时候You -- that I-- that is the twisted logic
用来给人洗脑的变态逻辑that they teach you when you sign up to be a Nazi.
你先等会儿  我才不是纳粹Stop. Wait. I'm not a Nazi.
你就是Yes, you are.
你就是个纳粹分子It is exactly what you are.
就写在神盾局手册第一章It's in the S.H.I.E.L.D. handbook, chapter one.
九头蛇的创建者红骷髅就是个纳粹The Red Skull, founder of Hydra, was a big, fat, freaking Nazi.
那跟今天的情况没一点关系That has nothing to do with today.
知道吗  你一直跟年轻的希特勒挺神似You know, you always had that Hitler youth look to you.
说来也算意料之中了So it's really not that surprising.
不是那样  我是个间谍  我有任务It's not like that. I'm a spy. I had a job.
你不知道杀了多少人You've killed I don't know how many people.
你现在要对我下手吗You gonna kill me now?
不  我不会伤害你的No. I would never hurt you.
等我解锁了硬盘  你要打死我吗Once I crack the drive, are you just gonna shoot me
像你打死托马斯·纳什那样like you did with Thomas Nash,
还是让别人替你动手or are you gonna have someone else do it,
比如奎恩like you did with Quinn?
我事前根本不知道会那样I didn't know that was gonna happen.
那完全是加勒特的决定That was all Garrett.
是啊  全都怨加勒特Oh, of course it was Garrett's fault.
那也是任务的一部分  是不是That was part of the mission, right?
你就打算眼看着我受折磨Just gonna kick back and watch me bleed
直到轮到你动手until it's your turn to pull the trigger.
你认为我跟那事有关吗You think I had a part in that?
我真会允许你出那种事That I would let that happen to you?
你知道我对你的感觉  斯凯You know how I feel about you, Skye.
慢着Wait.
就是说即便你一直So even though you've been lying
把所有人骗得团团转to everyone about everything,
但你对我还是有感觉的you're saying that your feelings for me --
这些感觉是真的  斯凯They're real, Skye.
一直都是真的They always have been.
我要吐了I'm gonna throw up.
你以为我就容易吗Do you -- do you think this has been easy for me?
你知不知道我有多煎熬Do you have any idea how hard it was?
知不知道我的牺牲  我的不得已The sacrifices, the decisions I had to make?
但我还是做了  因为这就是我But I made them. Because that's what I do.
适者生存I'm a survivor.
你是个杀人犯You are a serial killer.
还有And you know what?
有件事你还真说对了You were right about one thing.
我的确不喜欢真实的你I wouldn't like the real you.
总有一天Someday...
总有一天你会懂我的Someday, you'll understand.
我永远不会No. I won't.
而我也绝对And I will never...
绝对不会让你得逞ever give you what you want.
分析
破解硬盘
破解失败
地址无效  拒绝访问
加勒特不想等了  执行B计划
时间到Time's up.
你要么告诉我去哪解锁硬盘You can tell me where to unlock the drive,
要么告诉他or you can tell him.
麦克Mike...
求你了Please.
我知道你并不愿这么做I know you don't want to do this.
这我说了不算It's not up to me.
当然算  我不管他们对你做了什么Yes, it is. I don't care what they did to you.
你还是麦克·彼得森  是一位父亲You're still Mike Peterson. You're still a father.
你还有一个儿子You have a son.
而我把他交给了你们Who I left in your hands.
我还让你多照顾他  斯凯I asked you to look after him, Skye.
他现在在哪Where is he now?
他和他姑妈在一起He's with his aunt,
有一队神盾局特工在保护他under the protection of a S.H.I.E.L.D. team.
神盾局现在算什么And what is S.H.I.E.L.D. today?
九头蛇可以随时伤害我儿子Hydra can hurt my son anytime they want,
要是我动了营救他的念头and if I get any funny ideas about rescuing him,
他们只需按下按钮  就能炸碎我的头they push a little button and blow a hole in my skull.
菲兹-西蒙斯会有办法的Fitz-Simmons will figure out a way --
不  没有别的办法  斯凯No. There's no way out of this, Skye.
告诉我们  怎么解锁硬盘Tell us how to unlock the drive.
我不说No.
-该死  斯凯  -你在意大利本可杀了我- Damn it, Skye. - You could have shot me back in Italy,
但你没有but you didn't.
他们让奎恩下手  因为你还有良知  麦克They made Quinn do it because there's still good in you, Mike,
我觉得你不会伤害我And I don't think you're gonna hurt me.
你说得对You're right.
我不会伤害你I won't hurt you.
你对他做了什么What -- what -- what did you do to him?
让他的心脏停跳了Stopped his heart.
他的心脏...His heart...
停止跳动了  他正在心脏病发作Isn't beating. He's having a heart attack.
我可以让它重新跳动  或者不管I can restart it or not.
-你自己选择  -斯凯- It's your choice. - Skye.
你以为我不想看他受折磨吗You think I don't want to watch him suffer?
不是受折磨  是死掉Not suffer -- die.
加勒特觉得你不会放任不管Garrett doesn't think you're gonna let that happen.
他是个杀人犯He's a murderer.
没错  他是Yes, he is.
你是吗Are you?
-停下  -你要在哪解锁硬盘- Okay, stop. - Where do you unlock the drive?
-让他活过来  -在哪里- Bring him back! - Where?
三万五千英尺高空  解锁地址不是经纬度35,000 feet. It's not based on longitude and latitude.
-而是海拔高度  -你在说谎- It's altitude. - You're lying.
我没有  你...I'm not! You --
我输入密码后...就开始破解I put the password in and I -- I start the hack.
等我们到达指定高度  就可以解锁了And once we reach altitude, it unlocks.
让他活过来Now bring him back.
输入密码  开始破解Put the password in. Start the hack.
别耍花招No tricks.
你个狗娘养的You -- you son of a bitch.
去发动飞机Now get the plane in the air.
不行  我站都站不稳I can't. I can barely stand.
这应该就行了That should help.
玛丽亚·希尔呼叫神盾616号Maria Hill to S.H.I.E.L.D. 6-1-6.
给你30秒时间放下武器投降You have 30 seconds to stand down and surrender.
重复一遍  放下武器投降I repeat, stand down and surrender.
你要回答我  沃德  还是要我亲自过去You gonna answer me, Ward, or do I have to come over there?
玛丽亚·希尔Maria Hill.
我还希望你死在三曲翼总部了I kind of hoped you went down with the Triskelion.
我还希望你不是这么个下贱的两面派And I hoped you weren't the duplicitous lowlife you turned out to be,
但我们得面对现实啊but here we are.
实话跟你说吧  希尔Gonna be honest with you, Hill.
我今天过得挺糟的I'm having a pretty bad day.
如果我是你的话  就不挡我的道So if I were you, I'd get the hell out of my way.
把斯凯交出来  我们再商量Mm, give up Skye, and we'll talk about it.
那是不可能了Yeah, that's not happening.
我向来不喜欢你  沃德You know, I never liked you, Ward,
从我们第一次见面就是not since our first sit-down,
但我没想到你会是约翰·加勒特的走狗but I never figured you for john garrett's lapdog.
弗瑞选你作副手时我们很多人都嗤之以鼻A lot of us lost respect for Fury when he picked you as his second.
要是想选个花瓶养眼If he needed eye candy around,
至少也该选黑寡妇啊he could have at least picked Romanoff.
真搞笑  我会转述给她的That's funny. I'll tell her you said that.
把斯凯交出来Now hand Skye over,
不然我就派一队战斗机把你打得屁滚尿流or I'll have a squad of f-16s knock you on your ass.
就算你现在还有这个权限Even if you had that kind of pull anymore,
不过你没有  科尔森也不会让你这样做的which you don't, Coulson would never let you do it.
他绝不会这样拿斯凯冒险He would never sacrifice Skye like that.
但你知道加勒特会But you know Garrett would.
所以别跟踪我们So don't try and follow us.
你并不非得如此  沃德This doesn't have to go down like this, Ward.
你不欠加勒特什么You don't owe Garrett anything.
你错了You're wrong.
要我去追他吗You want me to pursue?
不用  追踪系统已经启动了No. Their tracking systems are up and running.
希望我们争取到了足够的时间Just hope we bought enough time.
你还好吧  沃德伤害你了吗Are you okay? Did Ward hurt you?
没有 我还好No, I'm okay.
但是加密硬盘...我为他们解锁了But the encrypted hard drive -- I unlocked it for them.
别管这事了  我们得快走Forget that. We need to move.
我们得拿下驾驶舱We got to take the cockpit.
等等  你一个人来的吗Wait. You came alone?
没事  我能搞定沃德It's okay. I can take Ward.
我知道  但你怎么搞定的死亡战士No, I know, but how did you get past Deathlok?
死亡战士在这儿吗  在飞机上Deathlok's here? On the plane?
是啊  你没拿下他吗Yeah, you didn't take him out?
新计划  快逃New plan -- run!
你怎么办W-what about you?
快去货舱  快去Get to the cargo hold -- now.
我不能让你走  科尔森特工I can't let you leave, Agent Coulson.
这还是我的飞机It's still my plane.
货舱舷梯开启
我不需要你的允许I don't need your permission.
货舱舷梯开启
我以前从没用过降落伞I've never used a parachute before!
别穿了  到车里去Forget that! Get in the car!
趴下Down! Get down!
系好安全带Buckle up!
都叫你系好安全带了I told you to buckle up!
肯定是推动器中枪了Come on! Must hit the frosters!
停车费20块That'll be 20 bucks.
我去降落飞机I'm putting the plane down.
我们得去追他们We need to go after them.
不行  我们按原计划进行No, we don't. We stay with the plan.
我不用听你的命令I don't answer to you.
科尔森和斯凯不重要了Coulson and Skye don't matter anymore.
我们拿到数据了  加勒特让我们马上回去We have the data and Garrett wants us back right now.
听着  我不会忘记你刚刚对我做了什么Listen, I'm not just gonna forget what you did to me back there.
你再干这种事  我就杀了你You try anything like that again, I will kill you.
这不是私人恩怨Wasn't personal.
我只是服从命令I was just following orders.
他居然开枪打洛拉I can't believe he shot Lola.
我不想谈这个I can't talk about it.
我不怪你要去追他Don't blame you for going after him.
我们需要作战基地  武器  战略支援We'll need a base of operations, weapons, tactical backup.
还有谁为你办事Who do you have working for you?
好吧  等等  科尔森Okay, wait, wait. Hold on, Coulson.
没有支援了There is no more backup.
没有秘密地堡了No more hidden bunkers.
我知道弗瑞还有其他的Oh, come on. I know Fury has others.
没有弗瑞了There's no Fury.
我们没法再重组团队了  科尔森We're not bringing the band back together again, Coulson.
结束了It's over.
神盾局不存在了There is no S.H.I.E.L.D. anymore.
明面上是没有Well...not officially.
我懂  好吗Look, I get it, okay?
你得干掉沃德和加勒特You have to take Ward and Garrett down.
但别装作这是受官方认可的任务But don't act like it's some officially sanctioned mission.
这是私人恩怨  了结后  你就该离开It's a personal vendetta, and when it's done, you should walk.
让你的手下各奔前程Let your people go their separate ways.
然后呢And what?
去自首  达成协议Turn themselves in? Cut a deal?
在私企工作Work in the private sector?
只要你开口  斯塔克一定会收留你You know Stark would take you in a heartbeat.
这不是我的风格It's not my style.
我该走了I should go.
你知道去哪找我You know where to find me.
替我跟斯塔克问好...Say hello to Stark for --
对啊Oh, yeah.
算了吧  他以为我死了Never mind. He thinks I'm dead.
沃德这样做肯定有原因Must be some reason why Ward did it.
也许他们给他洗脑了Maybe they brainwashed him.
不知道  有些人就是邪恶Don't know. Some people are just evil.
我宁愿不信那种观点I'd rather not believe that.
就是这样  我只是觉得我们该早点发现的It's true. I just assumed we'd be better at spotting it.
告诉我你不是九头蛇Tell me that you're not Hydra.
什么What?
我知道很荒唐I know that it's ridiculous,
但我得听你说出来but I just need to hear you say it.
我不是九头蛇I'm not Hydra.
很好  我也不是Yeah, good. Good. And I -- 'cause I'm not, either.
-当然不是  -嗯- Of course not. - Yeah.
因为如果你是Because if -- if you ever did...
-不会的  -我会不知所措的- I wouldn't. - ...I don't know what I would do.
你不需要考虑这种事You'll never have to find out.
还以为你不吃垃圾食品呢Thought you didn't eat junk food.
我在度假I'm on vacation.
到什么时候Until...?
到那个人告诉我该工作了Until that man tells me it's time to work.
今晚不会  享受生活吧Not tonight. Live a little.
那我就要疯狂一点  也许再来一包That case, I'm gonna go crazy. Maybe have another bag.
我以前从没有无家可归过Never been homeless before.
可不好玩It's not fun.
至少我们有泳池At least we have a pool.
我们会抓住他的We'll get him.
我知道I know.
我解锁硬盘时  给他们留了点小礼物I left them a little present when I encrypted the drive.
应该有帮助Should help.
谢谢Thanks.
今晚夜色不错Nice night.
《神盾局特工》马上回来We'll return in a moment.
我就希望你会回来I was hoping you'd come back.
-沃德...  -我知道- Ward is -- - I know.
希尔和我说了Hill told me.
你得看一样东西There's something you need to see.
十级机密通话塔希提计划负责人致弗瑞局长最终报告
你想知道塔希提计划的负责人是谁吗You wanted to know who was behind T.A.H.I.T.I.?
这是我的发现This is what I found out.
十级机密通话塔希提计划负责人致弗瑞局长最终报告
播放
早上好  弗瑞局长Good morning, director Fury.
很遗憾地告诉你  我要递交辞呈I regret to inform you that I'm handing in my resignation.
我知道你要我负责塔希提计划I know you brought me on to project T.A.H.I.T.I.
是因为相信我的判断力because you trusted my judgment,
而我的判断力告诉我And it's that judgment that's telling me
摸着良心  我不能允许测试继续I can no longer, in good conscience, let the testing continue.
我明白你启动这个项目I understand you started the program
是为了将来拯救身受重伤的复仇者to potentially save a mortally wounded avenger,
但是副作用太极端了but the side effects are too extreme.
宾主组织的再生能力方面We had initial success with the regenerative properties
的确获得了初步成功of the guest-host tissue,
但最初的身体恢复过后but after the initial physical recovery,
测试对象的心理状况开始恶化the subjects began to deteriorate mentally,
表现出多写症  失语症和紧张症displaying hypergraphia, aphasia, catatonia,
或者直接发展成精神病or just complete psychosis.
我们不知道是生物方面的作用We don't know if it was the biology at play
还是单纯因为记得这一过程or simply the awareness of what was done,
但是唯一可能but the only course of action that showed
消除这些副作用的做法any promise of stemming these side effects
就是记忆置换was memory replacement --
彻底抹除恢复过程的记忆erasing completely the awareness of what they'd been through.
即便如此  结果也极不一致And even those results were very inconsistent.
我明确表示To be clear,
建议终止塔希提项目I'm recommending the termination of project T.A.H.I.T.I.
这些疗程和药物Under no circumstances should these procedures
绝不能用于任何人or drugs be administered to anyone ever.
代价太过惨重The cost is far too great.
谢谢  长官Thank you, sir.
