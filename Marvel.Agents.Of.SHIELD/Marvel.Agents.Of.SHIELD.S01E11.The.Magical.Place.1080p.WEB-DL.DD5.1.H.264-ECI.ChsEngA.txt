我知道我不是梅或沃德那样厉害的外勤特工I know I'm not some badass field agent like May or Ward,
但这是我的专长but this is what I do.
你不能就这样把我踢出任务You can't just kick me off this mission.
我会对你言听计从Listen, I will do whatever you say.
我不在乎什么破章程All this protocol crap doesn't matter to me.
我只在乎科尔森All that matters to me is Coulson.

你的存在只会让人分心  给我走人You're a distraction, and you're gone.
汉德特工Agent Hand,
我知道斯凯的方法有些另类I know Skye's methods are unorthodox,

她帮得上忙的She can help.
梅特工  你的专业意见呢Agent May, your professional opinion --

送她去接受询问then have her delivered to debrief.
我来吧  我是她的监管人员I'll do it. I'm her S.O.
梅显然对我有不满It's clear that May has an axe to grind with me,
但这也太过分了but that was way out of line.
没人清楚梅到底在想什么No one knows what's in May's head except May.
别担心Don't worry.
