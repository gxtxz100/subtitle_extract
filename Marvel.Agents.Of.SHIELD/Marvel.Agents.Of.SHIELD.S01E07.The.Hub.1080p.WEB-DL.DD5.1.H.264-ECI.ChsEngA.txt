神盾局特工第一季 第七集By aBu 201705
我无意让你们担心I don't mean to alarm you,
但你们这里好像发霉了but I think you may have a mold problem.
水池里的积水尤其让人担忧That sink with the standing water seems especially concerning.
等审讯官来
他就笑不出来了
我很期待呢Looking forward to it.
情报在你身上吗You have the intel on you?
他们知道了They know.
是吗They know?
我们只有三分钟  肖特工We have three minutes, Agent Shaw.
该走了  各位特工Time to go, agents.
-从哪撤  -跟我走- Exit? - Follow me.
我还想你们去哪了呢I was wondering what you guys had been up to.
你先上Go.
好All right.
雪橇狗在哪Um, where are the dogs?
别逗了  用不着Don't be ridiculous.
我敢说通常都是你拿着这种东西I bet you're usually the one holding something like this.
别担心Don't worry.
她心里有数的She knows what she's doing.
不要呼吸哦Whatever you do, don't breathe.
开玩笑啦That was a joke.
如果需要的话  你当然可以呼吸You should, of course, feel comfortable breathing if you need to,
别用鼻子就行just not through your nose.
用嘴呼吸也要幅度很小And very minimally through your mouth.
拿到了There we are.
这是你获取的全部情报吗That's all the intel you recovered?
希望如此I certainly hope so.
谢谢你  肖特工Well, thank you, Agent Shaw,
安全地保管情报for keeping it safe up there.
我们会把它送回中心We'll push this through to the Hub.
事实上  我们正飞往那里  送你过去In fact, we're headed there now to drop you off.
换套衣服  吃顿像样的饭Get you a change of clothes, a proper meal --
你马上就能精神焕发You'll be good as new.
中心  真的吗The Hub? Really?
好激动  好久没去了How exciting. It's been ages.
很好Good.
鼻旁取出已经完成了Done with that paranasal extraction nonsense.
需要我分析数据吗Do you need me to analyze the data?
不必That won't be necessary.
如果加密了  我可以帮他搞定芯片If it's encrypted, I can mine the chip for him.
这项任务是机密I'm afraid this mission's classified.
需要八级权限Clearance level 8.
等等  什么Wait. What?
他一句话就可以把我们挡在外面吗He can just shut us out of the process like that?
他都说任务是八级的了Well, he did say the mission is level 8.
我们没那权限  所以我们不能知道And we're not, so we can't know about it.
但通常这时候Right, but this is normally the part
我们都围在全息屏前  了解任务where we all stand around the holocom and we learn about stuff.
我们不是一伙的吗I mean, aren't we all on the same team?
用不着搬出你那套社会主义论调No need to get started on one of your socialist riffs.
神盾局的基础结构是基于等级制度S.H.I.E.L.D.'s whole infrastructure is based on the hierarchy
和情报的权限划分and compartmentalization of intelligence.
不能让每个特工都知道每项任务的情报Every agent can't have the intel on every mission.
那会让整个组织变得脆弱Makes the entire organization vulnerable.
好吧  但是如果我刚从Okay, fine, but if I just fought my way out
西伯利亚的地下监狱打出来of an underground Siberian prison,
我会希望知道行动的目的I'd kind of want to know what for.
科尔森让你习惯了飞机上的套路Coulson's got you used to the plane,
我们这里的行动方式The way we do missions here.
在中心可完全不同The Hub is different.
中心The Hub?
中心是什么What's the Hub?
中心  地点: 机密
没想到老大哥这么大Didn't realize big brother was this big.
这不算什么Oh, this is nothing.
三曲翼总部才叫大呢Wait until you see the Triskelion.
所有人都穿着同样的服装Everyone's wearing the same suit.
谁能告诉我为什么Someone tell me why, please.
有我的吗Do I get one?
那是你的"徽章"That's your badge,
意味着你离一级都还差着远呢which means you've got a long way to go to even make level one.
收到Copy that.
那我是不是也不能用这里的任何一台电脑Does that also mean no access to any computers here whatsoever?
我可以搜索一下那份被神盾局编辑过我父母的文件I could run a search on the redacted S.H.I.E.L.D. file on my parents.
斯凯Skye.
我只是...But it just --
那份文件应该就会存在这种地方It seems like the place they'd keep them, right?
我会调查的I'll look into it.
但现在  我们手头上有更紧迫的事But right now, we've got more pressing matters at hand.
西特韦尔特工Agent Sitwell.
科尔森特工Agent Coulson.
很高兴你有所好转Good to see you feeling better.
汉德特工在战况室等你Agent Hand's waiting for you in the situation room.
她不太喜欢等人And she doesn't like to wait.
你认识她吗So you know her?
只是听说过Only her reputation.
你先请After you.
你的七级特工可以一起听简报Your level 7s can join us in the briefing.
笑一个Say cheese.
维多利亚·汉德Victoria Hand...
在这里Is here.
你这是在委婉地告诉我  我不能一起去吗Is this your subtle way of saying I can't come with?
我们马上回来We'll be back.
什Wha--
我们应该去技术走廊了We should probably head over to the tech corridor.
-我等不及想看新化学装备了  -是啊- Oh, I can't wait to see the new chem-kit. -Yeah
这地方肯定不喜欢我I don't think it likes me here.
汉德特工Agent Hand.
科尔森特工Agent Coulson.
很高兴终于见到本人了Nice to finally put a face to the name.
彼此彼此Likewise.
这是梅特工和沃德特工These are agents May and Ward.
介绍就到此为止吧Well, now that we've gotten that over with,
以下是你们可以了解的情报here's what you can know.
你们从肖特工手上拿到的情报The intel you recovered from agent Shaw
告诉我们一个南奥塞梯的独立派tells us that a separatist group from South Ossetia
制造了一件叫做"艾斯比图米特"的武器has built a weapon called Ezbiitometer.
超强杀伤性装置吗The overkill device?
以我的口味  略显做作A little dramatic for my taste.
大概是翻译缺少了原意的精髓I imagine something was lost in translation.
我们从拦截到的信号中得知We've intercepted chatter that tells us
他们打算在未来24小时内靠这件武器they plan to use the weapon in the next 24 hours
宣布从俄罗斯和格鲁吉亚独立to declare their independence from Russia and Georgia.
我们认为它能产生声振动We believe it creates sonic vibrations
其威力足以在远距离触发武器powerful enough to trigger weapons from a great distance --
从直升机上的导弹Anything from the missiles on a helicopter
到发射井里的核弹头to a nuclear warhead sitting in its silo.
如果我们对他们动武So if we move on them,
他们可以用我们的武器来对付我们they could use our own weapons against us.
没错Exactly.
所以我需要一支二人小队That's why I need a two-man team
偷偷穿过争议边界to sneak across the disputed border undetected,
闯进独立派要塞break into the separatist stronghold,
在24小时内拆除这件武器and disable the weapon in the next 24 hours.
你正好有两个手下适合这工作And you have two people who fit my bill.
没问题Not a problem.
我08年参与过格鲁吉亚战争I was in Georgia during the incursion in '08.
我在南奥塞梯边境仍有联络人I still have contacts on the South Ossetian border.
那你们要用上他们了And you'll have to use them.
但我们并不了解这件装置But we don't have specs on the device,
所以我需要你们派一个so I need someone on the team
能在现场识别出并拆除武器的人who can identify and dismantle it on-site.
你的意思是...Do you mean...
我想就是那意思I think she does.
我找到一个小范围电磁脉冲器和一些其他装置I found a localized E.M.P., plus a few other party favors.
拜托  搞什...Oh, come on. What the...
开门啊Open.
卡住了It's stuck!
小车被卡住了The cart's stuck.
难以置信That's unbelievable.
搞什么啊What the hell?!
谁设计的啊Who designed this?!
居然还是在中心In the hub, of all places.
这...Oh, that's...
当真吗Seriously?
真不敢相信你要去执行任务I just can't believe you're going in
而且一无所知dark,
又是敌方领土  不带通讯器in hostile territory, without comms,
而你手无缚鸡之力lacking any real physical strength.
我不会有事的I'll be fine.
抗蛇毒素我给你了吗Did I give you an antivenin pack?
高加索有很多当地独有的蜘蛛The caucasus have a plethora of highly endemic spider species.
珍玛  行了  别再担心我了Jemma, stop. Stop worrying about me.
我没问题的I can do this.
谢谢Thank you.
我不在的时候你别做什么傻事And don't you do anything rash while I'm gone...
比如从飞机上跳下去什么的...like jump out of an airplane.
你要小心Well, you'll be careful.
更糟糕的情况我都应付过Yeah, I've handled worse.
差点忘了  我给你做了这个Oh, I almost forgot. I made you this.
你最爱的三明治Your favorite sandwich.
意式熏火腿加水牛芝士Prosciutto and buffalo mozzarella.
加你自制的蒜泥蛋黄酱了吗With your homemade pesto aioli?
加了一点Just a hint.
你要的是这个吗Hey, is this what you wanted?
还有  这是什么Also, what is this?
菲兹Oh, Fitz.
大弹夹袋A full-sized mag pouch?
只是我必须做出的一个战术决策而已Just one of the many tactical decisions I've had to make already.
沃德说我们用得上And Ward said we needed it.
你们得在明早六点之前拆除超强杀伤性装置You need to disable the overkill device by 0600 tomorrow
以阻止独立派的攻击in order to prevent the separatist attack.
你们一给神盾局发信号Once you signal S.H.I.E.L.D.,
救援小队就会马上带你们撤离the extraction team will get you both out.
照顾好他Take care of him.
是  长官Of course, sir.
少说话多做事  沃德特工More moving, less talking, Agent Ward.
我们时间可不多Time's not on our side.
你觉得这样没问题吗Does this feel okay to you?
我们不该跟他一起去吗Shouldn't we be going with him?
策划本次行动的人员The people who put these ops together
都是精英中的精英are the best of the best.
他们心里有数The know what they're doing.
高加索山
西蒙斯这会儿还什么都不知道呢So Simmons, by this point, does not have a bloody clue.
我们在后面憋着笑You know, we're in the back, trying to contain our laughter.
西蒙斯走进了真空室So Simmons goes into the vacuum chamber wearing --
穿着兔子衣wearing a-a bunny suit.
我们这么叫是因为Um, we just call it that because it
那衣服罩住全身it covers your whole body.
她进了真空室So she's in the vacuum chamber,
摘下面具要跟我说话but when she takes her mask off to speak to me,
却打了个喷嚏  喷在了法拉第杯上she sneezes all over the Faraday cup...
多好笑which is funny.
带信标了吗Do you have the beacon?
带了Yeah.
很好笑啊  因为真空室很干燥But it's funny because vacuum chambers are so dry,
而这件仪器本来是要上太空的and this instrument was actually supposed to go into space.
里面有灵敏的化学成分It had sensitive chemical components.
西蒙斯讲这故事效果比我要好得多Simmons actually tells it a lot better than I do.
我的线人叫尤里·杜波斯基Listen. My contact's Uri Dubrovsky.
我们付钱让他带我们过边境We'll pay him to get us across the border.
我们认识很久了We go back,
但他不喜欢生面孔but he doesn't like new people,
所以闭嘴低头so keep your mouth shut and your head down.
晚上好
两杯纯伏特加  不加冰
一杯给我
一杯给我朋友尤里
能问问他们有什么现成的啤酒吗Um, can you ask what beers that they have on tap?
尤里是你朋友吗Uri is your friend?
是的Yeah.
尤里死了Uri's dead.
你在这里没朋友You have no friends here.
别别别Oh! No, no, no, no, no, no.
请小心点Please be careful.
你能想象要是菲兹回来Can you imagine what Fitz would do
发现"好梦"枪坏了会怎么样吗if the night-night gun was broken when he came back?
他出外勤不会有事吧Surely he'll be okay out there, right?
梅特工有七级权限Well, Agent May is level 7.
也许她能透露一点任务的消息Maybe she can give us an update on their mission.
这是说Does that mean
你知情  但不能透露给我们that you do know something and you can't tell us,
还是你也不知情or that you don't know anything?
这样面无表情是什么意思Which non-expression is this?
我们只知道该知道的We know what we're supposed to.
有更多信息  我们就作出反应When we have more information, we'll react.
好了  清场All right, clear out.
我要做些测试诊断  然后重启I need to run some diagnostics, then reboot.
你俩也是  都出去That means you two. Off.
也许你们可以容忍不明不白You guys may be okay with being in the dark,
我可不行but I'm not into it.
我要答案I need answers.
我知道谁有And I know just the person who has them.
谁Who?
科尔森Coulson.
当然是科尔森I'm obviously talking about coulson.
再安排三支空降小队在边境待命I'm going to need three more chalks queued up at the border.
第四支在亚美尼亚待命吗And a fourth standing by in Armenia?
想到一块儿了Great minds.
能从那架飞机上下来感觉很不错吧It must be nice to be off that plane.
我听说你已经差不多康复了I understand you're almost through your recovery.
飞机跟我的康复没有任何关系The plane has nothing to do with my recovery.
我只知道报告里的信息I only know what I've read.
弗瑞似乎对他喜欢的人格外关照Seems Fury has a soft spot for his favorites.
不是所有人都能被送去塔希提岛Not everyone gets sent to Tahiti.
那是个神奇的...地方It's a magical...place.
我只是想说回归一线部队的感觉一定很好All I meant was it must feel good to be back in the big leagues.
我的两个特工是这次行动的关键Two of my agents are the key to this operation.
我就没离开一线部队I never left the bigs.
希望他们像你说的那么好Let's hope they're as good as you think they are.
怎么回事What's happening?
他们怎么还没杀掉我们Why haven't they killed us yet?
我当然很高兴他们还没杀掉我们I mean, I'm glad that they haven't killed us yet.
他们在等他们的头儿They're waiting for their boss,
他来之前  我们得想个对策so before he gets here, we need a plan.
你能在水下屏气多长时间How long can you hold your breath underwater?
我不知道I don't know.
你知道什么叫"重击强塞"吗You familiar with the term "slam and cram"?
不  我也不想知道No, and I d-- I don't think I want to be.
你的小指对你有多重要How attached are you to your pinky?
非常非常重要  在你问出Very, very attached, and before you ask
其他吓人又含糊的问题前another terrifyingly vague question,
让我把话说清楚let me be clear.
任何需要牵扯到暴力的计划Any plan that involves even one of those scenarios
我都做不到isn't going to work for me.
实际上  我...As a matter of fact, I've --
听说你在找你朋友尤里I heard you were looking for your friend Uri.
尤里是独立派的朋友And Uri was friends with separatists.
你是独立派的吗Are you separatists?
不No.
我们是来阻止他们的We're here to stop them.
绝对是来阻止他们的Definitely here to stop them.
相信我Trust me.
如果你能帮我们越过边境If you could just help us get across the border --
我都错过比赛了
你在浪费我的时间  我把话说明吧You're wasting my time, so let me be clear.
你没有给我信任你的理由You've given me no reason to trust you.
信任对我来说就是一切And trust is everything to me.
你好  见到你可真好Hey. Fancy seeing you here.
斯凯Skye,
我说过我会查你父母的档案的I told you I'd look into the file about your parents.
我知道  我不是为那事来No, I know. That's not why I'm here.
我想了解一下沃德和菲兹的任务I wanted to know more about Ward and Fitz's mission.
菲兹不在  西蒙斯快要抓狂了Simmons is seriously starting to unravel without Fitz.
我知道这话不好听  但是你没有权限I know it's hard to hear, but you don't have the clearance.
但我有眼睛啊But I have eyes.
我看见六支全副武装的小队I saw six squads in full tactical gear,
三箱火箭炮three crates of RPGs,
还有一整队分析员前往指挥中心and a full crew of analysts head to operations.
你真打算告诉我Are you really telling me
这些都跟沃德和菲兹的任务无关吗that has nothing to do with Ward and Fitz's mission?
如果我是对的If I'm right,
你就别说话  就算承认了give me a signal by not saying anything.
要相信组织Trust the system.
进展如何How did it go?
一无所获Nothing.
他现在就好像是个机器人一样He's acting like a robot version of himself right now.
如果我们想知道真相If we want the truth,
就得自己去找we've got to get it ourselves.
好吧Okay.
那你的建议是...How would you suggest --
等等  不Oh, wait. No. No.
-是的  -不行- Yes. - No!
我不能跟你一起瞎折腾I can't be a part of your bad-girl shenanigans.
我喜欢循规蹈矩  该做什么做什么I like following the rules and doing what's expected of me.
这让我觉得安心It makes me feel nice.
西蒙斯  醒醒吧Simmons, wake up!
沃德和菲兹去执行绝密二人任务了Ward and Fitz went on a top-secret, two-man operation,
而且你看and look.
人越来越多There are more men.
要么是事情比他们说得还要大And either it's a bigger deal and they're not telling us,
要么就是出问题了or something went wrong out there.
也许我们帮不上什么忙And maybe there's nothing we can to do help,
但如果帮得上  我们一定得知道but we got to know if there is.
万一他们受伤了或是正在被拷打怎么办What if they're injured or being tortured somewhere right now?
菲兹Fitz.
被严刑拷打Tortured.
你究竟是怎么打算的What exactly do you have in mind?
好了  够低了Okay! Enough!
好吧Okay.
稍微往左一点  弗拉基米尔A little to the left, Vladimir.
慢点Gentle!
慢点Gentle.
就是这样  好了That's it. Okay.
能再给我点亮吗  玛塔Can I get a little more light down here, Marta?

你叫他小熊Little bear?
我喜欢他干活儿的样子I like watching him work,
真是只熊宝宝That little bear.
搞定了Okay.
小事一桩It's nothing.
真的Really.
我就是个普通人而已I'm just a man.
给这位普通人来杯酒Get this man a drink.
不用了  那就喝吧Oh, no. Here we go.
咸咸的Salty.
那...So...
我们谈正事吧Let's talk business.
你花了两百万卢布吗Two million rubles?
你得好好学学谈判技巧了We need to work on your negotiation skills.
我以为卢布跟比索一样不值钱I thought they were like pesos.
再说了And anyway,
你该感谢我you should be thanking me.
我们被绑着时  是我用小范围电磁脉冲器I shorted the fuse box with my localized E.M.P.
短路了保险丝when we were tied up.
真的吗Really?
没错  而且我的计划成功了Yes, and my plan worked
我们这不是越过边境了吗Because we're over the border now, aren't we?
我们停下来了  为什么会停下We're stopping. Why are we stopping?
别出声Quiet.
待在这里  我去看看什么情况Stay here. I'll check it out.
好吧Okay.
我们还是都待这儿吧Maybe we'll both stay here.
菲兹  又是边境巡逻Fitz! More border patrol.
我已经开溜了  快跟上Already moving! Hurry up!
抱歉  我打扰到你了吗Sorry. Am I disturbing you?
知道吗  我喜欢这架飞机You know, I like this plane.
我喜欢这里的工作方式I like the way we do things here.
大家都了解情况  没有繁文缛节Everyone's on the same page, no red tape.
目前看来  这还挺适合我们的So far, it's working for us.
至少对大部分人来说Most of us.
或许我是变心软了And maybe I'm getting soft,
但我不喜欢对我们的队员有所隐瞒but I don't like keeping things from our team.
如果你知道...If you knew --
不  你是对的No. You're right.
八级权限Level 8.
但是...But --
我懂的I know.
相信组织Trust the system.

我编写了一个伪装搜索程序I programmed it with a decoy crawler.
它会用我的网页浏览记录It'll use my browser history
模拟我平时的网上活动to simulate my usual online activity.
所以神盾局以为我在用你给我的笔记本So while S.H.I.E.L.D thinks I'm trolling Reddit and Facebook
上无聊的社交网站时with the laptop you gave me --
你其实是在入侵沃德和菲兹的任务文件You'll be hacking the files for Ward and Fitz's mission.
没错Right.
记住  你一插入闪存  你只有...And remember, once you plug it in, you'll only have about --

"好梦"枪就在那儿  我就...The night-night gun was right there, and I
我们需要帮助  你得去把梅找来We need help. You need to go get May.

几分钟时间访问中心的主机a few minutes of access to the Hub's mainframe
查清我们的队友出了什么事to find out what happened to our boys...

我很清楚这并不轻松  救世主先生Oh, I'm well aware it's not a picnic, Mr. Save the Day.

老鼠可以只管自己的事I mean, there you are, minding your own business,
散播污秽和疾病  找虫子吃spreading filth and disease, scavenging for grub worms
或是烂水果or rotten fruit,
然后突然就看到了when lo and behold, you see it --
意式熏火腿加水牛芝士三明治a prosciutto and buffalo mozzarella sandwich...
菲兹Fitz.
上面还有点蒜泥蛋黄酱...with just a hint of pesto aioli.
安静Quiet.
感觉到了吗Feel that?
是卡车A truck.
要过来了  快把袋子拉好It's coming. Zip up the mag pouch.
我说过会帮你找你家人的信息的I told you I'd get answers about your family.
我不是在找我家人的信息That's not what I was looking for!
我是想查查沃德和菲兹去干什么了I was trying to find out what was happening with Ward and Fitz.
那是机密行动That's a classified operation.
明明是自杀行动It's a suicide mission!
我都看到了I saw it all --
军队布置还有空袭安排The troop placements, the aerial assault.
沃德和菲兹一拆除装置Once Ward and Fitz disable that device,
就会对那里发动大规模进攻there's going to be a huge attack on that compound,
但是没有营救计划  你却没跟我们说with no extraction plan, and you hid that from us.
我没瞒你什么I didn't hide anything from you.
你是没有权限了解详情You don't have the clearance to know that.
神盾局就是这样吗Is that really what S.H.I.E.L.D.'s all about?
八级权限的命比五级权限的值钱Level 5s are more expendable than level 8?
我们对你来说就只是数字吗Is that all we are, just a number to you?
你说完了吗Are you done?
我不知道  你说呢I don't know. Am I?
如果神盾局对你有隐瞒If s.H.I.E.L.D. keeps a secret from you,
那肯定是有原因的it's for a good reason.
-秘密都只有自己知道吗  -不要打断我- So they can hold all the secrets. - Don't interrupt.
你刚黑进了八级权限的服务器You just hacked a level-8 secure server,
看到了自己不该看的行动计划saw operational plans that you have no context for.
万一情报泄露If details get out,
整个行动可能因此失败the whole operation could be compromised,
会有人因此丧命  包括沃德和菲兹lives could be lost, Ward and Fitz among them.
我知道  那两个正是我们担心的人I know. Those are two people we care about.
在飞机上时  你一直跟我说On the plane, you're always telling me
要跳出思维定势  所以我才违反规定to think outside the box, so I went off book
因为我想留个心眼保护他们'cause I was trying to watch their backs.
我们小队可以违反规定是因为有规定可循Our team can go off book because there is a book.
一个中心A hub.
一个可以作为坚强后盾的组织An organization watching our backs.
你说你想成为其中一员You claim that you want to be a part of that,
成为一名神盾局特工a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent.
不是吗Do you?
是的Yes.
因为有一天Because someday,
我可能会需要你背负一个秘密I may have to trust you with a secret,
我得确定你能保守住秘密and I need to know that you can keep it.
我可以问你个问题吗Can I ask you one question?
什么What?
你知道根本没有营救沃德和菲兹的方案吗Did you know there was no extraction plan for Ward and Fitz?
这是机密信息That's classified.
好了  快走Okay. Go. Go. Go.
快走Go, go, go.
我来发撤离信号I'll signal extraction.
好的Okay.
西蒙斯管这个叫"魔术窗"Simmons calls it "The magic window."
你可能会问  那是X射线技术吗You'd probably guess, "Is that x-ray technology?"
实际上这张纸里嵌入了S频段微波天线There are actually s-band microwave antennae embedded in this sheet.
工作原理更像是个雷达系统Works more like a radar system, really.
好了Okay.
我们来看看Let's see.
西墙这边有两个守卫Okay, we have two guards on the west wall.
两人都配备了自动武器Both carrying automatic weapons.
纠正一下  是三个守卫Correction. Make that three guards.
我们要对付三个守卫We have three guards now.
天哪Oh, my God.
天哪  沃德  那个人在袭击另两个人Oh, my God, Ward. He's attacking the others.
他朝我们过来了He's coming straight for us.
沃德Ward.
沃德Ward?!
快点  进来Hurry. Inside.
现在我明白了That makes sense now.
一定就是这个了This must be it.
好怪Weird.
内核一定在这里面  那才是重要部分Core must be inside here. That's what's important.
周围的这些管道只是为了增强和定位声波The piping around it just serves to amplify and direct the sound,
以便远距离引爆炸药to trigger munitions from a distance.
看起来不像是能把飞机炸下来的东西Doesn't look like it could take a jet out of the sky.
你现在应该知道了  沃德特工Well, you should know by now, Agent Ward,
人不可貌相that looks can be deceiving.
好了吗Good?
好了Yeah.
这可能要费点时间This is gonna take a while.
给你十分钟You have 10 minutes.
我以为你会说五分钟I thought you'd say five.
西特韦尔特工现在在医务室Agent Sitwell is in the infirmary.
是你的一名队员把他打晕了Apparently, a member of your team rendered him unconscious.
只是个误会A misunderstanding.
我会内部解决的I'll handle the matter internally.
击晕一名特工可不能算是误会Tranquilizing an agent does not qualify as a misunderstanding.
你说得对You're right.
但在没有营救小队的情况下But being told there's an extraction team in place
却被告知有when, in fact, there isn't,
这是误会了吧that does.
我有八级权限I'm level 8.
我有权知道关乎我队员安危的信息I'm entitled to information regarding the welfare of my team.
你应该告诉我You should have told me.
看来我用不着说了Seemed I didn't have to.
知道了又能怎样呢  科尔森特工And what would that have changed, Agent Coulson?
你自己也曾设计过很多这样的任务You yourself have designed dozens of operations like this.
你了解这种情况You know how this works.
通常我们都有个营救计划Usually with an extraction plan.
巴顿[鹰眼]  罗曼诺夫[黑寡妇]Barton, Romanoff --
他们从来没有营救计划they never have an extraction plan.
但他们一开始就知道了They know that going in.
菲兹特工根本没有实战经验Agent Fitz is unproven in the field,
知道实情只会让他分心  泄气and knowing would have caused him to lose focus or courage.
那也该由我来决定That should have been my call.
我担心你不会答应I wasn't sure you'd comply.
你队伍里有一个戴电子手铐非特工人员Your team includes an electronically tagged non-agent
而且以泄露机密闻名who is notorious for leaking secrets,
这倒提醒了我which reminds me --
你是怎么得知这些信息的how did you get this information again?
我知道一千条人命的价值I know what the safety of a thousand men is worth.
我也知道销毁超强杀伤性武器的重要性I know the importance of taking the overkill device out of play.
但我也了解我的手下和他们的价值But I also know my men and what they're worth!
是否参加行动该由他们来决定The decision to go in should have been theirs to make.
也许吧Perhaps.
但你要相信组织  科尔森特工But you need to trust the system, Agent Coulson.
好了All right.
告诉我拆除这东西的最后步骤吧Show me the final steps to disable this thing.
我来搞定I'll get it done.
不  我们要按撤离方案来No, we stick to the extraction plan.
还有一分钟我就搞定了I'll be done in a minute.
撤离方案没指望了The extraction plan's a bust.
什么What?
撤离小队没联系上Exfil team didn't make contact.
等你把那东西拆了Once you take that thing apart
我触发远程信标  我们就只能靠自己了and I set off the remote beacon, we're on our own.
你该走了You should go.
我不走I'm not leaving.
菲兹  没时间争论了Fitz, there's no time to argue.
你觉得我搞不定吗You don't think I can't handle this?
不是  我只是想保护你No, I am trying to protect you.
你觉得我是个胆小鬼  是吧Ah, you think I'm a coward. Is that it?
什么  当然不是What? No.
我和你一样是一名神盾局特工I am every bit the S.H.I.E.L.D. agent that you are.
你不用证明什么You don't have anything to prove.
你说我总是从天而降英雄救美What you said about me always needing to swoop in --
我知道换做是你  也会跳下飞机救西蒙斯I know you would have jumped out of the plane to save Simmons,
她也知道这点and she knows that, too.
我并不是想证明什么I'm not trying to prove anything to anyone.
我们离开之前Okay? Before we left, you're not the only one
科尔森也找过我that Coulson talked to, okay?
他也叫我照顾你He told me to take care of you, too.
所以我要照顾你And that's exactly what I'm gonna do.
我哪也不去I'm not going anywhere.
你明白吗You understand?
而且我要饿死了And I'm bloody starving.
你拿到情报了  我们要做出反应You got the information. Now we react.
我们要去接我们的队员We're gonna get our guys.
总得有人去Somebody has to.
那神盾局的袭击呢What about the S.H.I.E.L.D. assault?
我们不去干预We won't interfere.
撤离行动不需要一营的人You don't need a battalion for an extraction.
三个人就能做到Three can pull it off.
四个人更好Four's better.
你来吗You're in?
不是要有八级权限才能讨论这事吗I thought we all had to be level 8 to discuss this.
我们什么也不讨论We're not discussing anything.
最后一次机会  菲兹Last chance, Fitz.
你真不想先撤吗Are you sure you don't want a head start?
因为你一扯掉最后那根电线Because the second you pull that final wire --
轮到你了Your turn.
信标接通了  装置拆除了Beacon's hot. The device is disabled.
开始行动Mission's a go.
好了  菲兹  我们走吧Good, Fitz. Let's go.
我们得在他们发现We need to slip out of here before
装置关闭之前溜出去they notice the device is powered down.
明白Got it.
我们需要一个新计划We need a new plan.
-你确定这能行吗  -当然- Are you sure this is gonna work? - Yes.
理论上可行Theoretically.
等等Hold it.
好了  完成Okay. Finished.
那是怎么回事What was that?
是神盾局S.H.I.E.L.D.
他们已经开始攻击了They've started their attack,
我们没多少时间了  这里很快会被炸毁which means we don't have much time before they crush the compound.
爬上去Get up there
用那玩意尽可能多地击落他们的武器and take out as many of their weapons as you can with that thing.
菲兹Fitz!
你后面Behind you!
我把他踹晕了I just did that.
好了  我们走吧Okay. Let's go.
你说他们需要像你我这样的人是吗You said they needed a guy like me and a guy like you, right?
是的Right.
撤离小队来了It's the extraction team!
比那还好Better.
是铁骑It's the Cavalry.
这场面怎么也看不厌Never get tired of seeing that.
科尔森的手下脱险了吗Are Coulson's people clear?
脱险了They are.
我以为没安排撤离呢I thought there wasn't gonna be an extraction.
我们的人力都用在别处了All our resources were needed elsewhere.
再说这是科尔森特工的队伍  他们不需要帮助And it's Agent Coulson's team. They didn't need one.
好了  去善后吧Okay. Let's mop up.
谢谢来接应我们  长官Thanks for coming to get us, sir.
我们要照顾好自己人We take care of our own.
干得好  菲兹Well done, Fitz.
真高兴你安然无恙So glad you're all right.
是啊Yep.
再见到你也很高兴Good to see you, too.
那个三明治怎么样The sandwich...how was it?
蒜泥蛋黄酱放多了吗Too much aioli?
很美味It was delicious.
有那么一会儿You know, for a second there,
我以为自己得另找一个监管人员了I thought I'd have to find a new supervising officer.
抱歉让你失望了Sorry to disappoint.
事实上  有人照顾着我呢Truth is, I was in good hands.
我一直都照看着沃德I had Ward's back the whole time.
是啊Yeah.
可以说从一伙俄罗斯暴徒手中把他救了出来Pretty much saved him from a gang of Russian mobsters
还撂倒了几个家伙and kicked a few guys' heads in.
任务的事不多说了But enough mission talk already.
中心有什么令人激动的事吗Um, anything exciting happen at the Hub?
我朝一位上级长官胸口开了一枪I shot a superior officer in the chest.
我在想今天的事  我非常抱歉...I was thinking about today, and I'm really sorry...
我只是想让你知道我没有忘记I just wanted to let you know that I didn't forget
你在中心拜托我的事about what you asked me back at the Hub.
什么意思Uh, what do you mean?
关于你过去的未编辑档案The un-redacted file about your past.
我找到了I found it.
上面说了什么Uh, w-what did it say?
文件不是直接关于你的The document wasn't about you directly.
而是关于送你去孤儿院的那个人It was about the person who dropped you off at the orphanage.
那人是一名神盾局特工Turns out, it was a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent.
神盾局特工A S.H.I.E.L.D. agent?
为什么  是谁  那是什么意思  我...Why? I mean, who? What does that mean? I --
特工身份不明The agent was unidentified.
我们不知道她是你母亲We don't know if she was your mother
还是单纯是捡到了你or if she just found you on a doorstep.
母亲Mother?
是个女的吗It was a woman?
我提交了进一步查看I put in a request to dig further into the files
一切相关材料的申请for any related materials,
但目前  我只知道这些but right now, that's all I have.
我很抱歉I'm sorry.
抱歉Sorry?
我要谢谢你Thank you.
非常感谢你Thank you so much.

你跟她说了什么What did you tell her?
事实The truth.
一名神盾局特工把她送去了孤儿院I told her a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent dropped her off at the orphanage.
但你没告诉她原因But you didn't tell her why.
我开不了口I can't.
有些秘密不该说出来Some secrets are meant to stay secret.
你能帮我查明到底发生了什么吗Will you help me find out what really happened?
趟浑水啊Dangerous waters.
不过我可以试试看But I can try.
谢谢你Thank you.
