中国  香港
我爷爷常说每个人都有秘密
有的秘密很美丽
有的秘密很黑暗
他认为  了解人性
唯一的方法
就是剥开外壳
观其内里
就是个小戏法
是藏在蛋里面了
这不是戏法
你怎么做到的How did you do that?
魔术师从不泄露天机A magician never reveals his secrets.
那我就只能剥开你的外壳  观其内里了Then I'll have to pierce your shell and gaze within?
你听懂了You understood.
陈浩然Chan Ho Yin.
蕾娜Raina.
我想再看一遍那个火戏法I would love to see that fire trick again.
我觉得那不是个好主意I don't think that's a good idea.
当然Of course not.
是个超棒的主意It's a great idea.
屋子有点乱  很抱歉I am sorry for the clutter.
我最近居无定所I'm in between places.
你在香港待多久了How long have you been here?
六年Six years.
喝啤酒吗Beer?
你似乎很喜欢胡迪尼啊You seem to have an appreciation for the greats.
我崇拜他很多年了I idolized him for many years.
现在呢And now?
真正的魔法是不存在的There's no real magic there,
只有戏法just tricks.
你的表演And what you do --
不是戏法吧those aren't tricks?
给我看看Show me.
抱歉I'm sorry.
-我不该表演那个  -谁说的- I really shouldn't.  - Says who?
你在怕什么What are you afraid of?
不是我在怕It's not me who's afraid.
这不可能是真的That can't be real.
自己试试See for yourself.
你这样多久了How long have you been able to...
第一次是几年前First time was a few years ago.
一条洗碗巾在我手里着了A dish towel caught fire in my hands.
我差点烧掉我的公寓I almost burned down my entire apartment.
难道不疼吗And it doesn't hurt?
一点也不Not even a little.
你天赋异禀You have a gift.
我从未见过这种事I've never seen anything like it.
为什么不让全世界看到呢Why not show the world?
我每天都在问同样的问题I ask that same question every day.
有些人...There are people who...
不提了Never mind.
只是  多年来It's just... for years,
我像其他人一样  变戏法I did illusions, tricks, like the rest.
结果突然有了这本事And then this happens.
这是真正的"魔法"It's real -- real magic.
如果我相信奇迹的话  我会说这是一个奇迹If I believed in such things, I would say it was a miracle,
这发生在我身上是有原因的That this happened for a reason.
我认为这是你命中注定I believe you've been chosen.
是吗You do?
闭上眼睛...Close your eyes...
...我会让你看到...and I'll show you.
可以睁眼了That'll do.
从现在起  你做出的每个决定Every decision you make from here on out
都会产生不同的后果has consequences.
别说我没警告你So be warned...
我可动真格的了the kiddie gloves are off.
G7G7.
伤Hit.
噢耶Yes! Ha!
再解释下这跟我的训练有什么关系So, explain to me again what this has to do with my training.
评估学员的思维过程It's important for every S.O.
对每一位监管人员来说都很重要to evaluate their student's thought process.
而且我喜欢桌游  B10And I like board games. B10.
没中  这根本不叫思考Nope. This isn't thinking.
你是在乱戳This is stabbing in the dark,
不过能在艰苦训练中偷闲也不赖but it's nice to take a break from the workouts.
你表现不错  应该休息下You deserve a break.
科尔森确实有一套I got to give Coulson credit.
我绝不会把一位前涨潮组织黑客I would have never pegged an ex-Rising Tide hacker
视为合适人选  但...as a good fit, but...
你学得很快you're picking things up pretty fast.
你刚刚在表扬我吗Did you just give me a compliment?
我没有  我只是在发表评论I-- no, I made a comment.
一句好评哦A kind one.
赞美一句会让你肉痛吗Did it physically hurt to do that?
你需要敷冰袋吗Do you need an ice pack?
一句表扬和一个微笑呀Wow. A compliment and a smile.
只是个评论而已Comment.
我不想毁了这一刻I don't want to ruin the moment,
但我的回报是...but I'm gonna have to respond with...
G4G4.
说出来吧  沃德Say it, Ward.
说吧Say it.
-你击沉了我的战舰  -好棒- You sank my battleship.  - Yes!
好了  三局两胜All right, best 2 out of 3.
-我打败你了  -三局两胜- I beat you.  - Best 2 out of 3.
-赢你个一比蛋就挺好  -她适应得很好- Best I just won out of nothing.  - She's fitting in nicely.
沾沾自喜呢Gloating?
有一点A little.
你今天起得很早嘛You were up early this morning.
我开始练太极之前  就听见你到处转悠了Heard you puttering around even before I started tai chi.
睡不着吗Having trouble sleeping?
没有  感觉好极了No, I feel great.
只是有些多余能量要释放Just have a little extra energy to burn.
如果你想If you want,
我可以在楼下铺上垫子I could lay out the mats downstairs.
我们可以练上几个回合We could go a few rounds,
像以前那样like the old days?
算你逃过一劫Saved by the bell.
陈浩然Chan Ho Yin --
只是个竭力维生的街头艺人  直到几年前just a struggling street performer until a few years ago,
陈先生开始逐渐展示出稳定的控火能力when Mr. Chan began to exhibit moderate pyrokinetic abilities.
他从哪来的超能力So what gave him powers?
还在调查当中It's still under investigation,
但是废弃的万泰核电站着火时but Chan did live near the decommissioned WanTai Nuclear Plant
陈就住在附近when it caught fire.
据我们所知To our knowledge,
附近没有其他居民表现出类似特征no other nearby residents have exhibited similar traits.
那我们是怎么知道他的So how did we find out about him?
有线人看见了他的街头表演Informant saw him lighting torches in a street show...
用小指点燃了火把with his pinkie.
由此引起了神盾局的注意Brought it to S.H.I.E.L.D.'s attention.
我们叫他不要随便运用此能力We told him to keep his abilities under wraps.
从那之后  他就被列入名录了He's been on the Index ever since.
什么名录The Index?
是神盾局登记的异能人士和物件名单It's a list S.H.I.E.L.D. keeps of people and objects with powers.
什么  名单上有多少人啊Wait. What? How many are there?
你是说还有很多人...Are you saying there are more people --
没有很多Not many.
都够列个名单出来了...Well, enough to keep a list.
一份很短的名单  意在保护他们A short list, meant to protect them.
但少数情况下  神盾局也会采取行动Though, in rare cases, S.H.I.E.L.D. has had to take action.
采取行动对付物件还是人Action against objects or people?
还真是让人诚惶诚恐啊Well, that's drastic with a side of creepy.
你们怎么监控他们的How are they monitored --
窃听电话Tapped phones,
卫星监视satellite surveillance,
在隐蔽不舒服的地方放身体探针body probes in dark, unpleasant places?
身体探针Body probes?
这太荒谬了Now, that's ridiculous.
神盾局不会这么做的S.H.I.E.L.D. doesn't do that.
我们不会这么做的  对吗We don't do that. Do we?
采取手段各有不同The methods vary.
陈先生威胁性不强Mr. Chan was low-risk.
指派监控他的特工会每隔几天去看看他He was assigned a case agent who checked in with him every few days.
所以我们才发现他不见了That's how we discovered him missing.
关特工  你好吗
还凑合吧
这位是关特工Everyone, this is Agent Kwan,
陈浩然的监察特工Chan Ho Yin's case agent.
有什么消息吗What can you tell us?
恐怕没多少消息Not much, I'm afraid.
陈是个魔术师  起初Chan is a magician, so at first,
我还认为他把自己变没了I thought he'd made himself disappeared.
报告上说你之前曾发现他违反名录协议The file says you'd caught him violating his Index agreement before.
他曾两次On two separate occasions --
说"我们妨碍了他的艺术表达"claimed we were "Hampering his artistic expression."
但昨天深夜But late last night,
他却被专业人士带走了he was taken by professionals.
他们只留下了The only thing they left behind
这一小片镀铝材料was this scrap of aluminized material.
防火服Fireproof clothing.
也就是说  带走他的人知道他的能力So whoever took him knew about his power.
没错  原因我们已经查明了Yes, and we think we know why.
这几天Over the last few days,
技术部门发现我们的数据流出现了缺口tech division discovered a crack into our data stream.
和之前入侵我们的是同一群技术宅It's the same cyber punks who hacked us before.
不知道怎么  他们又侵入了Somehow, they got in again.
是涨潮组织It's The Rising Tide.
还在线吗Hello?
怎么这么安静It got real quiet.
你们还在吗You guys still there?
涨潮组织是一个庞大的The Rising Tide is a huge organization
全球性黑客组织of hacktivists from all around the world.
可能是任何一个人干的Any of them could have done this.
-不是我干的  -没人说是你- It wasn't me. - No one's saying it was.
但你们是这么想的But you're thinking it.
看你们的表情就知道I can see your faces thinking it.
我们在评估现在的情况We're assessing the situation.
那你们一定会考虑Then I'm sure you're taking into account
我这段时间一直跟你们住在飞机上that I have been living on a plane with you this whole time.
我不可能侵入神盾局It would be impossible for me to hack S.H.I.E.L.D.
或者更容易了Or easier.
仅凭这点远不够洗脱嫌疑We're gonna need more than that.
好吧  让我来追踪这黑客  我能证明给你们看Fine. Let me trace the hack, and I'll prove it.
我相信她  长官I believe her, sir.
如果她说的是真话And if she's telling the truth,
我们要查出做这事的人we need to track down the person responsible.
去查吧  要快Dig up something, and fast.
陈先生失踪越久他就越危险The longer mr. Chan's missing, the more danger he's in.
早上好  陈先生Good morning, Chan.
搞什么鬼What the hell?
对昨晚的事  我深表歉意I apologize for last night.
我必须在不被人发现的情况下  把你带过来It was important I bring you in under the radar.
是神盾局啊Oh. S.H.I.E.L.D.
告诉关特工  他不用提醒我那破协议的事Tell agent Kwan I don't need to be read the power protocols again.
那只是街头表演It was just a street performance --
我又没把谁点着It's not like I set anyone on fire.
我不是神盾局的人I don't work for S.H.I.E.L.D.
我是你的朋友I come as a friend.
英语虽然不是我母语English isn't my first language,
但那个词跟你想的不是一个意思but that word means something different than you think.
我能理解你的沮丧I understand your frustration,
但我相信你有天赋but I believe you have a gift.
如果你愿意And if you let me,
我愿意帮你培养这天赋I'd like to help you nurture it.
我可以强化它I can increase it.
到时  大家都会关注你You'll get people's attention then.
强化我的能力Increase my power?
为什么  你有什么目的Why? What's the catch?
我想做些测试I'd like to run some tests.
终于到重点了There it is.
你是要放我走呢Now, will you let me go,
还是要我杀出去or must I fight my way out?
你现在离开  我会忘了你Leave now, and I'll forget you,
这我保证  其他人也会忘了你I promise, but so will everyone else.
留下来  你能名留青史Stay, and you can be remembered,
享誉世界known the world over.
你想让陈浩然出名吗You want to make Chan Ho Yin a famous name?
不No.
你需要一个简单点的名字You need a simpler name,
更有力的名字a -- a more powerful name,
比如说A name like...
炙炎侠Scorch.
炙炎侠  你在开玩笑吗Scorch? Are you joking?
你听说过史蒂夫·罗杰斯吗Have you ever heard of Steve Rogers?
没有吧No.
但是美国队长呢But Captain America--
新闻  饭盒  墙上的海报到处有他Now, he's on the news, on a lunchbox, on a poster on the wall.
我不想做超级英雄I don't want to be a superhero.
你想让世人You want to be recognized...
知道你的能力for your gift.
还有谁比他们更具辨识度呢And who is more recognizable than them?
我得到这能力是有原因的I was given this power for a reason.
我只想让大家看到我的能力I just want people to see what I can do.
他们会的They will.
我想达成的  正是你的愿望All I want is what you want --
让你名留青史for you to be remembered,
让你成为本该成为的人...to be seen for what you're meant to be...
一个明星...A star.
炙炎侠Scorch.

我查一下那一天的信用卡消费记录I'm gonna check to see if any credit-card charges
能否与任何已知黑客匹配上from that day match up with any known hackers.
找到了We got a hit.
迈尔斯·莱登  不是斯凯Miles Lydon, not Skye...
大家可以松一口气了that's to all of our relief.
你认识他吗You know him?
全世界的黑客都认识他Every hacker in the world knows him.
不光是黑客Not just the hacker world.
他入侵过克里姆林宫He infiltrated the Kremlin.
没错  那张普京光膀子骑马的照片...Yeah, the picture of, uh, Putin shirtless on horseback...
就是他的杰作that was his hack.
致使陈被绑架也是他的杰作It was also his hack that got Chan kidnapped.

德克萨斯州  奥斯汀

我可能发现他了I may have eyes on him.
他发现我了I've been made.
正在第五大街往东去Heading east on 5th Street.

你把那些文件泄露给谁了Who did you leak those files to?
等一下  搞什么Wait a second. What?
"见到你也很高兴  迈尔斯""Good to see you, too, Miles."
我把文件公诸于世了  本就该如此I released them into the world, where they belong.
如果没有其他目标They'll keep hunting you
他们就会一直追捕你unless they have someone else to look for.
而且你为什么要黑神盾局And why the hell would you hack S.H.I.E.L.D.?
因为我们就是干这个的Because that's what we do.
我在他们内部时你不该这么做Not when I'm on the inside.
你可能会毁掉一切  你个笨蛋You could have ruined everything, you dumbass.
看来你应付得很好嘛Seems like you handled it.
我已取得重大进步  不能被你...I've come too far for you to --
你为什么用那种眼神看着我Why are looking at me like that?
你刚才叫我笨蛋了吗Did you just call me "Dumbass"?
别笑  我很严肃的Stop smiling. I'm serious.
你的本事都是我教的Because I taught you everything you know,
-如果我是笨蛋的话你是什么  -才没有- so what does that make you?  - No, you didn't.
对不起  我只是情不自禁I'm sorry. I can't help it.
我想你都快想疯了I've been missing you like crazy.
你就把它放在那里啊That's where you keep that, huh?
总比被抓现行强Better safe than busted.
那方面有什么进展吗Making any progress on that?
我还在查I'm digging,
不过你这么一搞  查起来要更困难了but your little stunt is gonna make it harder.
我的上衣哪去了Where's my top?
我能帮上你You know, I could be helping you.
如果你把密文发给我If you send me ciphertext,
我能研究下算法什么的...I could be working on algorithms...
不行  我不能联系你No, I can't contact you.
我就不该联系你I never should have.
现在有一队神盾局特工在找你There's a S.H.I.E.L.D. team looking for you right now --
我的队友my team.
如果他们对我起疑And if they suspect something,
我就完蛋了[乱搞]I'm screwed.
我在忍着不开玩笑呢There's a joke here that I'm resisting
跟"乱搞"一词有关that involves the word "screwed."
别闹了Shut up.
有个男人因为你而陷入麻烦There's a guy in trouble because of you,
我得赶紧回去and I got to get back.
如果你真想帮我  就帮我找衣服So if you want to help me, help me find my clothes.
我很抱歉  斯凯I'm sorry, Skye.
如果我惹了麻烦  那真的很抱歉Really, I am, if I messed anything up.
我很想你I've missed you.
我也是Me, too.
但我去洛杉矶之前我们就讨论过了But we talked about this when I left for L.A.
这是我的机会I've got a chance here.
不要碰神盾局  好吗So S.H.I.E.L.D.'s off-limits, okay?
好吧Okay.
至少跟我说说那是什么感觉吧At least tell me what it's like.
你可是深入敌军内部啊Come on, the belly of the beast.
出人意料的...友善Surprisingly... unbeastly.
跟我共事的都是好人I've got good people I'm working with.
还是有些精彩的故事吧Some good stories, though, I hope?
迈尔斯Miles.
你简直无法想象You have no idea.
但那都是机密信息But that's classified.
真不敢相信你居然说这种话You did not just say that to me.
你总得告诉我点什么吧  Come on, you got to tell me something.
以后吧Someday.
如果他们能让你休假什么的Well, if they ever let you go on leave or whatever,
告诉我  我开间套房等你let me know, and I'll get us a suite at the...
找家有套房的高级酒店fancy hotel that has suites,
你就可以一丝不挂地给我讲故事了and you can regale me with stories while naked.
套房  你吗  太好笑了A suite? You? That's funny.
但如果我还不赶紧找到上衣的话But they're never gonna let me go on anything
我就别想有什么...if I don't find my stupid...
...假期了...top.
穿上衣服Get...dressed.
我知道这看起来...I know how this looks --
你们保持联络多久了How long have you two been in contact?
我加入那天联系了一次I contacted him once the day I joined
告诉他我很好  再就是今天早些时候to tell him I was okay and once earlier today.
你给疑犯通风报信When you tipped off an active suspect?
不是你想的那样No, it's not like that.
迈尔斯和我...Miles and I --
我们认识的时候情况都比较糟We met when we were both a little screwed up.
不对  是他比较糟糕  我是非常糟Scratch that -- he was a little screwed up, I was a lot.
但我们一直互相照顾对方But we looked after one another.
所以我才给他提个醒That's why I warned him,
并不是因为我们是共犯not because we're working together on this,
而是因为我们是...朋友but because we're... friends.
我真的很抱歉I'm really sorry.
知道了Noted.
如果不是你  那莱登先生在跟谁合作If not you, then who is Mr.Lydon working with?
没人  他是个理想主义者No one. He's an idealist,
他崇尚信息自由believes in freedom of information.
这份信息害一个男人失去了自由That information cost a man his freedom,
而你破坏了我们补救的机会and you sabotaged our attempts to remedy that.
不  我来是为了查明迈尔斯对陈有多少了解No, I came here to find out what Miles knows about Chan.
-然后呢  -什么都不知道- And? - Nothing.
一无所获  迈尔斯不是威胁Miles is a dead end. He's harmless.
看情况再说We'll see.
真的  我本打算找到一切线索帮你们Really, I was gonna find out everything I could to try to help.
我只是觉得...没法对你们坦白一切I just -- I felt like I couldn't tell you guys everything.
我明白I know.
所以我才让梅跟踪你That's why I asked May to follow you.
看来这不是一无所获Seems that wasn't a dead end.
为什么斯凯会为了他这样对我们Why would Skye do this to us for him?
我还以为我们是朋友I thought she was our friend.
我想她是的  菲兹I think she is, Fitz.
但他显然不止是朋友He's just obviously more than that.
但我们一起经历了那么多Yeah, but we've been through so much together,
她居然都不告诉我们她有男友and she didn't even tell us that she has a guy.
谁知道他们又一起经历过什么呢Well, who knows what they've been through together?
你从我们这儿窃取的机密信息The classified information you stole from us --
你给了谁who did you give it to?
那是信息It's information.
它不受任何人控制It has a life of its own.
陈先生怎么了What happened to Mr.Chan?
我不知道他是谁  不如你告诉我I don't know who that is, so why don't you tell me?
你们打算把我所有的东西都砸了吗So, are you guys just gonna destroy all my stuff?
是的Yes.
有发现吗Anything?
-我没有必要跟你交代任何事  -把他带回去- I don't have to talk to you. - Take him in.
收集所有证据  控制住犯人Gather all the evidence and secure the prisoners.
我们已经拿到了在这儿要找的东西We got what we were looking for here.
我们去香港We're going to Hong Kong.
真对不起  沃德I'm so sorry, Ward.
事情不是你想的那样This is not what it looks like.
手伸出来Hands.
站起来Now get up.
你少扣了一个扣子Uh, you missed a button.
中国  香港
这是什么地方这么大  蕾娜What is this big place, Raina?
这些人又是谁And who are these guys?
他们会满足你的任何需要They'll assist you with anything you need.
我们要在观察你能力的同时We're here to monitor your vitals
监测你的体征while we observe your powers.
这里之所以大是因为我们需要空间And it's big because we'll need the space.
这种血清可以强化你身体里This serum strengthens the cytoskeleton
每个细胞的细胞骨架within each cell of your body.
只要一剂  你会有不可思议的感觉One dose, and you'll feel incredible...
直到它失效until it wears off.
它会失效吧And it will wear off?
是的Yes.
但在普通实验个体身上得到的效果很不错But the effects in average subjects have been impressive.
我很期待你将产生的效果In you, I'm excited to see.
你觉得炙炎侠这个名字怎么样What do you think of the name "Scorch"?
呼吸Breathe.
感觉到了吗Feel it?
让我们看看你的能耐吧Now let's see what you can do.
不好意思Oh, sorry!
你差点被炙炎灼伤了You almost got Scorched.
太不可思议了This is incredible.
你是个美丽的天使  你知道吗You are a beautiful angel -- you know that?
你的能力是个了不起的天赋Your power is an amazing gift.
神盾局不许我使用它And S.H.I.E.L.D. wouldn't let me use it.
多亏了你But thanks to you,
世界终于能看到我的能耐了the whole world can finally see what I can do.
从现在起  没人能阻碍我了From now on, nobody holds me back.
看来正当法律程序不是神盾的行事作风So, I guess due process isn't really S.H.I.E.L.D. protocol.
他们没有时间They don't have time for it.
你在替他们辩解吗Whoa, are you defending them?
这些人践踏了我们的基本权利These people are denying our basic rights.
这事跟你我无关This isn't about us.
他们想去救一个人They're trying to save someone's life.
听听你说的话Listen to yourself.
这是他们为侵犯隐私开脱的一贯说辞  斯凯That's what they always say to justify invading privacy, Skye.
这些人代表着我们鄙视的一切These people stand for everything we despise --
秘密  审查secrets, censorship --
省省你的宣言吧  迈尔斯Enough with the manifesto, Miles.
我们不能放过他们We can't let them get away with it.
地点  审讯室镜头02
曼宁  斯诺登  亚伦·斯沃茨Manning, Snowden, Aaron Swartz --
前两人分别将军方和CIA机密文件泄露给维基解密  后者公开反对网络审查监控
他们是当代革命家These are modern-day revolutionaries.
现在的情况跟那些无关This has nothing to do with that.
你泄露了You leaked --
这男的就是在闪烁其词Guy's hiding behind platitudes.
他绝对有问题  我能感觉到He's dirty. I can feel it.
但他几乎什么资料都没有Scrubbed clean, actually -- nothing much on him.
他没有家庭记录He's got no family records.
公寓登记的是化名His apartment's under an alias.
他还很爱玩"我的世界"And he plays a lot of "Minecraft,"
他在里面经营一个厉害的黑帮where he runs a rather nasty mob.
是僵尸吗Is it -- is it zombie?
僵尸猪人Zombie Pigmen.
继续查Keep looking.
想说什么就说吧Go ahead. Say it.
我没那么小气I don't do petty.
但你预料到了But you called it.
我相信了自己的直觉I trusted my gut,
虽然你认为她是个隐患even though you said she was a risk.
如果有人闯进我家When someone breaks into my house,
我通常不会邀请那人留下  但那是我I usually don't invite them to stay, but that's me.
我本来也是那样That was me, too.
但后来外星人的权杖刺穿了我的心脏Then that alien staff went through my heart.
你确定被刺穿的不是你的脑子吗Sure it didn't go through the brain?
你也不怎么安慰人是吧You really don't do comforting, either, do you?
你现在的直觉是什么What is your gut telling you now?
她还是有所隐瞒That she's still hiding something.
长官  我们找到证据了Sir, we found some evidence.
她一直在维护你  说你是个正直的人She's been defending you, saying you're a stand-up guy.
那我就给你次机会So I'm going to give you a chance.
是你跟她说  还是我说Do you want to tell her, or should I?
我没必要听你的I don't have to listen to you --
你没机会了  我来There goes your chance.
你男友在信息泄露后几天里Your boyfriend here made a few deposits
去存了几次钱in the days following the leak.
总额大约是100万美金All said... it's about a million dollars.
怎么回事What?
-还真是正直啊  -我可以解释- Real stand-up guy. - I can explain --
你是在贩卖信息吗Did you sell information?
迈尔斯Miles?
是还是不是Yes or no?
-是吗  -是  但...- Did you?! - Yes, but --
