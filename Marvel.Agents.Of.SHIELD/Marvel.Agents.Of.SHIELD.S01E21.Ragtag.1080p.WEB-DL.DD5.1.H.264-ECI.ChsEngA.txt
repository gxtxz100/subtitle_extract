-沃德是九头蛇的人  -不  我不相信- Ward is Hydra. - No. I don't believe it.
沃德是九头蛇
你以为我不想看他受折磨吗You think I don't want to watch him suffer?
不是受折磨  是死掉Not suffer -- die.
告诉我们  怎么解锁硬盘Tell us how to unlock the drive.
我开始破解I start the hack.
等我们到达指定高度  就可以解锁了and once we reach altitude, it unlocks.
让他活过来Now bring him back.
这些小药瓶里装着These vials contain the raw materials
让科尔森起死回生的灵丹妙药of whatever jesus juice brought Coulson back from the dead.
没有你的帮助我做不到I can't succeed without your help.
我们需要作战基地  武器  战略支援We'll need a base of operations, weapons, tactical backup.
没有支援了  结束了There is no backup. It's over.
神盾局不存在了There is no s.H.I.E.L.D. anymore.

格兰特·沃德Grant Ward?
15年前
我叫约翰·加勒特My name's John Garrett.
你军事学校的军需官是我的老伙计The quartermaster at your military school's an old buddy of mine.
他告诉我有个脾气暴He told me about a pissed-off young cadet
手眼协调能力极好的年轻学员  开小差with off-the-chart eye-hand coordination who went awol,
偷了辆车  驱车一千英里回家stole a car, drove over a thousand miles home
只为把那儿付之一炬only to try and burn the place down.
我得说这样的年轻人让我很感兴趣I must say, I find a young man like that intriguing.
我很好奇I'm curious.
你放火的时候知道你哥哥在屋子里吗Did you know your brother was in the house when you set it on fire?
不  先生  我不知道No, sir, I did not.
我小时候也爱玩火I was a pyro as a kid, too.
没想到长大了竟能以此为生Ended up making a pretty good living at it.
我是来给你一个一次性的机会  听好了I'm here to make you a one-time offer, so listen up.
你家的律师20分钟后到Your family's lawyer's gonna be here in about 20 minutes.
你父母不仅要起诉你Not only are your folks pressing charges against you
纵火及谋杀未遂for arson and attempted murder,
你哥哥还向法庭请愿but your older brother's petitioning the court
把你当做成人审判to have you tried as an adult.
你可以选择接下来几年待在牢里Now, you can spend the next few years locked up in a cage,
怨爹怨妈blaming mommy and daddy
和你那恶毒的哥哥and mean older brother for your problems,
也可以选择离开这里or you can let me get you out of here
让我教你做个真男人and teach you how to be a man.
我为秘密组织工作I work for a secret organization
需要招募你这样的年轻人that's always looking to recruit young men like you.
我为什么要相信你And why should I trust you?
你不该相信我You shouldn't.
不要相信任何人  尤其是我Don't trust anybody, ever, especially me.
话说明白Let me be clear --
跟我混将是你做过的最辛苦的事Going with me will be the hardest thing you've ever done.
但好处是  将没人敢再惹你But on the other hand, no one will ever screw with you again.
答应吧Say yes.
辛苦但也很有趣It'll be hard but fun.
十秒后  我就走人10 seconds, and I walk out that door.
答应吧Say yes.
好Yes.
把枪放下Gun down.
都趴下Everybody down! On the ground!
都别动Nobody move!
我说了会很有趣的I told you it was gonna be fun.
目击者称袭击者撞破了几道墙Eyewitnesses claim the assailant smashed through several walls
然后杀死了哥伦比亚最臭名昭著的毒枭before killing Colombia's most notorious drug lord,
亚历杭德罗·卡斯蒂洛  外号斗牛犬Alejandro Castillo, A.K.A. El Dogo.
大家都在猜测这宗超人的刺杀行动的凶手Speculation continues as to whether this superhuman assassination
究竟是一个人  怪兽还是机器was carried out by a man, monster, or machine.
正确答案是D  以上三项都是The correct answer is "D," all of the above.
死亡战士去波哥大干什么What the hell is Deathlok doing in Bogota?
他为什么要杀死一位与九头蛇有关联的毒枭And why would he kill a drug lord with known ties to Hydra?
如果他们真在哥伦比亚Well, if they really are in Colombia,
那加勒特和我们被劫的飞机then Garrett and our hijacked plane
可能根本就不在美国领空aren't even in American airspace.
我得扩大搜索范围I have to expand our search.
伙计们Guys...
过来一下You want to come in here for a minute?
这是我们目前的全部麻烦This is just about everything we've been dealing with.
这个And this...
赛博科技
将他们联系了起来...connects them all.
赛博科技创造了死亡战士  给奎恩递送过东西Cybertek built Deathlok, shipped items to Quinn,
奎恩为千里眼效力who was working for the Clairvoyant,
奎恩
千里眼
沃德和加勒特
千里眼是加勒特  他把沃德安插在了空客上who turned out to be Garrett, who planted Ward on our bus
因为他想知道我是怎么起死回生的because he wanted to know why I didn't stay dead.
这部分应该再画一个图Should have drawn another chart for this part.
不用  懂了No, I get it --
一直以来  是加勒特在开发蜈蚣血清Garrett's been developing centipede serum all this time.
-是的  -他需要GH325作为最后的成分- Yes. - And he wants GH-325 as its final ingredient --
让蜈蚣战士得以稳定化且有再生能力A way to stabilize and regenerate his centipede soldiers.
这也是沃德回来破解硬盘的原因And it's why Ward came back for the hard drive.
上面有全部关于科尔森和斯凯的研究资料It had all of your research about Coulson and Skye.
都在上面It's all on there.
不只是这些But that's not the only thing on there.
斯凯给他们留了小惊喜Skye left them a little surprise.
特洛伊病毒A trojan horse.
在慢慢探查他们上传了硬盘资料的每个系统It's been slowly mapping every system they've uploaded it to.
-厉害  -特洛伊病毒- Well, that's brilliant. - Trojan horse.
你可以唤醒它  夺下系统You can wake it up and take over their systems.
-干得漂亮  斯凯  -谢谢- Well done, Skye. - Yeah. Thanks.
但是还有一点小问题Except it doesn't work that way
因为我没有时间制造完整的病毒because I didn't have enough time to build it,
所以我们得把这个插到他们一台电脑上so we need to plug this into one of their computers
以激活病毒to activate it.
剧透一下  我们找不到他们的电脑Spoiler alert -- we can't seem to find one.
我觉得能找到I think we have.
加勒特和赛博科技合作了多年Garrett and Cybertek have been working together for years.
如果资料在加勒特的系统里If it's on Garrett's system...
也一定传到赛博科技的系统里了It's on cybertek's.
因此我们需要潜入他们的一间办公室Which is why we're gonna go into one of their offices.
赛博科技
死亡战士
蜈蚣血清
我们没有权利展开这项行动We have no authority to do this.
我们不再是神盾局特工了  我们是We're no longer S.H.I.E.L.D. agents. We're...
义警We're vigilantes.
我本来想说  因为这是正确的事I was gonna say, "Doing this because it's the right thing to do,"
你这么说也行But...yeah.
如果你们愿意与我并肩作战So, if you're with me,
我要结束我引起的这一切I'm gonna finish what I started.
我绝不允许加勒特和沃德逃脱制裁I'll be damned if I'm gonna let garrett and Ward get away with murder.
而且我要把飞机夺回来And I want my plane back.
我能干掉那个毒枭I could have crossed off that drug lord
而且不会被拍到without getting my picture taken.
半英里外  一击毙命Single shot, half a mile away.
你没抓到重点You're missing the point.
我不只是想除掉他I didn't want to just cross him off.
我想展示给大家看I wanted to make a spectacle.
波哥大每天都有人被枪杀People are killed by guns every day in Bogota.
但什么时候见过一个怪物But how often does a monster
一拳把毒枭的头给打掉呢punch a drug lord's head clean off?
这可是国际新闻Hell, that's international news.
你做得太棒了  麦克Spectacular thing you did back there, Mikey.
要不是我了解你If I didn't know better,
我会以为你开始喜欢你的工作了I'd swear you're starting to enjoy your job.
你觉得他开始喜欢这份工作了吗You get the impression he's enjoying his job?
肯定有人这么觉得Somebody does.
我愿意认为我们都喜欢自己的工作Well, I'd like to think we all enjoy our work.
为什么不呢And why not?
现在是回报丰厚的好时候啊These are exciting times full of rewards.
这也提醒我了Which reminds me...
泽勒  是我Zeller. Yeah, it's me.
今天下午给麦克·彼得森传一些他儿子的视频Stream Mike Peterson some video of his son this afternoon.
不客气Don't mention it.
那家伙怎么样  我改变了他的人生How about that guy? I've turned him into a new man.
他真的是人吗Is that what he is?
你还在记恨他对你做的事吗Are you still sore about what he did to you?
不  我记恨的是你下的命令No, I'm sore at you for making him do it.
我们马上就要完成一件Look, we're on the verge of completing something
我追求了25年的事了I've been chasing for 25 years.
你就不能为我感到高兴吗Can't you just be happy for me?
你看  这才像话See? That's what I'm talking about.
-开心的人  -我想你也会开心的- Happy campers. - I think you'll be happy, too.
治愈了斯凯并让科尔森起死回生的药物We're close to replicating the drug that healed Skye
马上就要复制成功了and brought Coulson back to life.
斯凯硬盘里的数据The data from Skye's hard drive,
里面的研究  帮了大忙all that research -- been a big help.
我把数据都上传到了古巴的实验室I've uploaded everything to the lab in Cuba.
我们降落时他们就应该有初步结果了They'll have initial results by the time we land.
你从不让人失望  是吧  花裙妹You never disappoint, do you, flowers?
我的手下都有你的成功率就好了Wish everyone on my team had the same success rate.
好的  那我们下午见Okay. We'll see you this afternoon.
我们预约上了赛博科技We're on with the R&D department
在帕罗奥图的研发部门up at Cybertek's Palo Alto offices.
没事的  菲兹It'll be okay, Fitz.
不论他们查得多深No matter how deep they dig,
他们只能查到我伪造的新身份they'll only find the new identities I've created.
不是为这个It's not that.
是因为要把我们的设计拿给他们It's the idea of giving them access to all of our designs.
我们不会真给他们任何东西We're not actually giving them anything.
我们只需要潜进去  好把斯凯的闪盘We just need to get inside so we can plug Skye's flash drive
插在他们一台电脑上into one of their computers.
你不用去You don't have to go.
也不是这个It's not that, either.
是沃德It's ward.
加勒特会不会也给他装了个假眼炸弹呢What if Garrett put an exploding eye into him,
好控制他to control him?
也许这才是他背叛我们的原因Maybe that's why he betrayed us.
我想原因比这个简单多了I'm pretty sure there's a much simpler reason.
他就是坏He's evil.
我不相信人生来就是坏的Well, I don't believe that people are born evil.
一定是发生了什么事Something must have happened.
很抱歉用了这么久Hey, sorry it took so long.
我妈真的很舍不得My mom's real sentimental about
我外公的咆哮突击队装备granddad's howling commando stuff.
崔普很慷慨地拿给我们Trip was generous enough to offer up
一些他外公的间谍设备some of his granddad's spy tech to help us out,
我们应该系统地清点一遍里面的...so we should systematically take a full inventory of ev--
我的天  那是手持催眠枪吗Oh, my god. Is that a handheld hypno-beam?
原版试用品之一One of the original betas.
看到底部这个按钮了吗See how it has the switch on the bottom?
成品把它挪到侧面了The production models moved it to the side.
这太棒了This is amazing.
都可以媲美Almost as cool as a...
-晶体管冲击波枪  -晶体管冲击波枪- Transistorized blast gun. - Transistorized blast gun.
好吧Ah, ha ha. Okay.
你们俩可以回头再缠绵The two of you can get a room later,
我们现在要赶飞机了but we have a plane to catch.
别动No.
这些东西都在哪买的  漫画书背面吗Where did they buy this stuff, from the back of a comic book?
别动  姑娘  那不是蜂鸣器  那是Come on, girl, that's not really a joy buzzer. That's a --
电磁脉冲E.M.P.
能在十英尺半径内造成断电Knocks power out in about a 10-foot radius.
是啊  好多老式神盾局间谍装备Yeah. A lot of vintage S.H.I.E.L.D. spy craft
有意设计得很普通  以防特工暴露was designed to look innocent in case a spy was caught.
比如说  这个Like, um...Okay.
比如这些香烟Like these smokes.
谢了崔普  这些工具非常有用Thanks, Trip. This is a huge help.
让我们有实力与敌人抗衡Gives us a fighting chance against these bad guys.
天哪  菲兹Oh, Fitz.
当心了九头蛇  我们杀回来了Watch out, Hydra. Here we come.
15年前
等我退休了就住在这儿I'm gonna retire out here one day.
一千亩的怀俄明林地和牧场  钱都付了A thousand acres of Wyoming woods and meadows, already paid for.
说话啊  小子  我又不是读心人Speak up, son. I'm not a mind reader.
警察发现我们怎么办What if the police find us?
根本没人在找你Nobody's looking.
你家人巴不得你就此消失Family will be happy to never see you again.
至于警察嘛As for cops, well...
他们最好别插手神盾局的事They do best when they stay out of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s way.
神盾局学院就在附近吗So, is S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy near here?
眼下你有比那更要紧的事Right now, you have more pressing issues,
比如你今晚吃什么like what you're gonna eat tonight.
我以为你拿的就是我们的晚饭I-I thought that was our dinner.
不  这是我的晚饭  我打来的我吃No, this my dinner. I shot them, I eat them.
就连巴迪都比你有资格吃这些猎物Hell, Buddy deserves these birds more than you do.
毕竟是他叼回来的He retrieved them.
在外面混  你想要的东西必须自己挣Out here, son, if you want something, you have to earn it.
从现在起  吃穿用全靠你自己了From here on out, you earn everything.
想要个睡觉的地方就自己搭You want a warm place to sleep, you make it.
想有东西吃就自己去打You want something to eat, you kill it.
等等  你不是认真的吧Wait, wait. Y-you can't be serious.
这包里只有几件衣服All -- all I have in here are some clothes.
这根本不公平Right? This isn't fair.
如果你预先告诉我  我会带些工具补给If you'd have told me, I-I'd have brought tools or food --
自己疏忽大意别来怨我Stop blaming me for your own failure!
让人很难欣赏你Makes me not like you.
你想轻松些  那就回少管所去You want it easy? Go back to juvie.
他们会给你个小隔间和一张床They'll give you three squares and a cot.
去证实你家人对你的看法吧Confirm what your family believes,
去证实所有人对你的看法what everybody believes --
格兰特·沃德软弱无能That Grant Ward is weak and worthless.
这么着吧  我把巴迪留给你I'll tell you what -- I'll leave Buddy here.
你要是能照顾他  没准他也能照顾你You take care of him, maybe he'll take care of you.
我过几个月就回I'll be back in a couple of months.
到时你还能不能活着Either you'll be here or you won't.
就看你了It's up to you.
但无论如何But for what it's worth...
我相信你撑得住I believe you can do it.
加利福尼亚州  帕罗奥图  赛博科技
你们好  欢迎来到赛博科技  请坐Hi. Welcome to Cybertek. Sit. Please.
我是研发部高级副主管奥特  这位是迪亚兹I'm Ott, senior V.P. of R&D. This is Diaz.
我是西奥·蒂特尔  这位是罗姆博士I'm Theo Tittle. This is Dr. Roum.
多谢你们能抽空见我们Thanks so much for seeing us on such short notice.
我们最近也见过不少We've met with a number of other
前神盾局的科学家former S.H.I.E.L.D. scientists recently,
不得不说  到目前为止  我们...and I must say, thus far, we're...
比较失望underwhelmed.
而九头蛇的人  他们的思路更为发散Hydra, on the other hand, less constrained in their thinking.
-也更年轻  -都很年轻- And younger. - Usually younger.
是啊Yeah.
我就说该我们去I told you we should have gone in.
你省省吧Oh, hush.
梅看起来顶多May looks barely a day over...
30岁30.
你很好看的You're gorgeous.
发射机位置锁定  扫描超高频
咆哮突击队1分领先Score one for the howling commandos.
你外公的胸针应该能帮我定位赛博科技的主机Your grandpa's pin should help me locate Cybertek's mainframe.
他那个年代还有无线网络吗I didn't know they had wi-fi back in the day.
没有  这就是胸针的妙处They didn't. That's the beauty of the pin.
它用超高频搜索数据It uses UHF to search for data.
如今没人会在那么高的频率上搜索漏洞了Nobody's even scanning those frequencies for potential leaks.
未检测到数据信号
奇怪了That's weird.
我什么数字信号都没搜到I'm not finding any digital data about anything,
更别说信号源了let alone a source for it.
这怎么可能How is that possible?
也许主机被保护起来了Maybe it's protected.
或者  被隔离起来了Or...insulated somewhere inside?
两位  让他们再拖一会儿Guys, just keep them busy a minute longer.
好  把冰冻枪子弹给他们看Okay, now, show them the icer bullet.
我的设计威力巨大I designed this to be powerful...
我的设计威力巨大  又不致命  会在...I designed this to be powerful, nonlethal, and to break --
会在皮下组织爆裂break up under subcutaneous tissue.
而我的设计难点就在于子弹只能装载And my challenge was that it could only hold a dose of...
85微克的树眼镜蛇毒素85 micrograms of dendrotoxin.
他做子弹模具之前真该跟我商量一下He should have run the specs by me before building the molds.
但我想我们都能认同But I think we can all agree that the...
真正的精妙之处在于我的高浓度that the true beauty is in my hyperconcentrated...
-树眼镜蛇毒素配方  -还有我的弹壳- dendrotoxin formula... - My cartridge-case...
-高浓度树眼镜蛇毒素配方  -弹壳发射系统- concentrated dendrotoxin formula - cartridge-case ejection system,
-和压缩空气喷射  -明摆着的- with compressed air expulsion. - obviously.
这样的子弹我们已经见过了We've seen one of these bullets before.
这个是干什么用的来着What did they use it with?
好像是"睡睡"枪The sleepy-sleep gun, I think.
没错That's right.
我们团队研究了这种原始设计Our team took this rudimentary concept
进一步研制出了麻醉烟雾弹and converted it into an aerosol grenade.
有用得多Much more useful.
但这可是冰冻弹啊But this is an icer!
就是  这可是冰冻弹Yes, but this is an icer.
制动能力是原来三倍Triple the stopping power
而且有个酷得多的...名字and a much cooler...name.
两位还有别的东西吗What else do you have?
找到了Here we go.
这是赛博科技提交到市里的建筑许可Building permits Cybertek's filed in the city.
四楼有点古怪There's something funky about the fourth floor.
只有一个出入口Only one way in or out.
安全门经过特殊强化Extra-reinforced security door.
肯定就在那里  对吧That's got to be it, right?
科尔森  梅  你们能去四楼吗Coulson, May, can you get to the fourth floor?
很遗憾不能与你们合作It's a shame it didn't work out.
是啊It is.
跟你们俩见面很愉快So lovely meeting you both.
你的毛衣痒不痒Does your sweater itch?
有一点A little bit.
不知道我说得次数够不够多I don't know if I've said it enough, but...
我很高兴你回来了I'm glad you're back.
可别把窗帘点着了Try not to set the drapes on fire.
斯凯  我知道你为什么找不到主机了Skye, I think I know why you couldn't find the mainframe.
根本就没有There isn't one.
什么叫根本没有What do you mean there isn't one?
所有的文档都是纸质的All the files are hard copies.
所以我们开会时老奶奶一直在打字That's why granny was typing during our meeting.
来都来了  干脆到处找找吧Well, we're here. Might as well look around.
你又在盯着我看了You're staring at me again.
你把我儿子给了他们You gave them my son.
如今我只能看到他被关在小房间里的照片All I see are pictures of him in a cell.
我只是在服从命令  跟你一样I was following orders. Just like you.
那么也有人在扮演你的上帝吗So, is someone playing god with you, too?
你看到的他都能看到Seeing everything you see?
如果你不听话  就按下按钮把你脑袋炸个洞Waiting to push a button and blow a hole in your skull if you disobey?
有吗Is there?
没有No.
那你为什么还在这里Then why are you here?
为了你和其他像你一样有天赋的人For you and others like you -- people with gifts.
我在等待内在的展现I'm waiting for what's inside to be revealed.
那个女孩  斯凯  你知道些什么The girl, Skye... what do you know about her?
她从哪里来Where does she come from?
你为什么关心这个Why do you care?
因为从内在讲Because inside,
我认为我们有些共同之处I believe she and I have something in common.
科尔森Coulson?
麦克·彼得森的档案Mike Peterson's file.
这怎么可能全都是死亡战士的资料How can this all be Project Deathlok?
1990年1990?
这计划到底进行了多久How far back does this thing go?
赛博科技  型号一  版本1.01  1990年
约翰·加勒特
加勒特是第一个死亡战士Garrett was the first deathlok.
走吧Let's go.
斯凯  崔普  准备进行大型文件传输Skye, Trip, get ready for a large file transfer.
有多大How large?
后退Back it up!
你差点害死我You were gonna let me die!
首先  说话别这么大声First off, I think we should use our indoor voices.
从我遇见你  你要我做什么我都做了Since the day we met, I have done everything you asked.
恐怕不能说得这么绝对吧Not sure we can say "everything."
你为了拿到硬盘  会不惜让死亡战士杀死我吗You were gonna let deathlok kill me to get that hard drive?
得了吧  我们都知道那姑娘不会让你死的Come on. We both know the girl wasn't gonna let you die.
你说过斯凯容易心软  跟你一样You said yourself Skye's a soft touch, just like you.
我不再是那个害怕的孩子了I am not that scared kid anymore.
那就别一副熊样Then stop acting like it!
别再软弱Stop being weak.
这么多年了  你还在扮演受害者的角色All these years, and you're still playing the victim.
有时候我都不知道当初是何必Sometimes I ask myself why I ever bothered.
约翰  约翰John! John!
所有人都出去  马上Everybody out! Now!
好了  抬上来There it is. Here we go.
好了That's it.
我说了  出去I said, "Get the hell out!"
你听到他的话了You heard the man!
好了  坚持住All right, hang in there.
我帮你稳定下来I'll get you stabilized.
加勒特1990年就开始了死亡战士计划Garrett started Project Deathlok way back in 1990.
看  他就是第一个试验对象Look at this. He was patient zero.
我们一直都想错了We've been looking at all this backwards.
加勒特不仅是想给他的蜈蚣战士弄到GH325Garrett doesn't just want GH-325 for his centipede soldiers.
他自己也想要He wants it for himself.
这样他就能重新变成血肉之躯So he can become a real, live boy again.
而且如果他碰巧And if he happens to create
同时为九头蛇创建了一支an army of programmed super soldiers
超级战士军队  那就一举三得了for Hydra along the way, triple bonus points.
我们怎么知道加勒特不是那样对沃德的How do we know Garrett didn't do that to Ward, too?
也许他被洗脑了Maybe he's been programmed.
菲兹  你什么时候才肯相信Fitz, when are you going to stop clinging to the idea
沃德不是受害者  而是加害者that Ward's the victim and not the perpetrator?
当我看到切实证据的时候When I see something that tells me I shouldn't with my own two eyes.
我们不知道全部的真相We don't know all the facts.
你想要真相吗  菲兹  沃德杀了人You want a fact, Fitz? Ward murders people.
我真该在有机会的时候让麦克干掉他I should have let Mike finish him when I had the chance.
我真是又愚蠢  又软弱I'm stupid and...weak.
你不是软弱You weren't weak.
你是有同情心  那更不容易You had compassion. That's harder.
我们会找到他的We'll find him.
巴勃罗·吉梅内斯的披萨Pizza delivery for Pablo Jimenez?
是我的That's me.
生物假体重启Biomechanics rebooting.
好了  应该没问题了There. That should do it.
你吓死我了You scared me.
好久没这样了Hasn't happened like that in awhile.
不  一直这样Yes, it has.
而且越来越频繁Been happening more and more.
生物假体没问题The biomechanics are fine.
是我的器官快不行了It's my organs that are failing.
你在说什么  约翰What are you saying, John?
我快死了I'm dying.
赛博科技的人说我还有一个月  最多两个月Cybertek team gives me a month, two tops.
你没出来吃东西You never came out to eat.
没什么胃口Not much of an appetite.
听我说Look...
菲兹暂时还无法接受沃德叛变的事Fitz can't process the truth about Ward, not yet.
他所说的话What he said...
是他需要坚信的It's what he needs to believe.
你认为沃德是被人控制了吗Do you think Ward's being controlled?
绝对不是Absolutely not.
我也认为不是Neither do I.
我之前真的看低了You know, I never gave you enough credit
你冷静处事的态度for this whole zen-warrior thing.
但我得承认  现在能毫无感觉也挺好But I got to admit, it'd be nice to feel nothing right now.
你以为我毫无感觉吗You think I don't feel anything?
看看你  就是座雕像Look at you. You're a statue.
你和沃德还有过瓜葛呢And you and Ward had a thing.
如果有人应该感到愤怒So if anyone should be furious --
我很愤怒I am.
怒火中烧I'm furious.
但我不会浪费时间发脾气But I'm sure as hell not gonna waste it on a tantrum.
我要憋住一口气I'm gonna mine it, save it...
等我们找到沃德And when we find Ward,
我要用尽那股怒火来拿下他I'm gonna use every bit of it to take him down.
但愿我知道如何利用那股怒火Wish I knew how to use that hate-fu.
我几乎每天早上都是五点起床I'm up most mornings at 5:00.
崔普查到一些赛博科技的货物Trip I.D.'d a number of cybertek shipments
在全球各地运来运去that ping-ponged across the globe --
巴西  柬埔寨  叙利亚Brazil, Cambodia, Syria --
但最后都运去了哈瓦那but they all ended up in Havana.
神盾局以前在那儿有基地S.H.I.E.L.D. used to have a base there.
我就说会找到他的I told you we'd find him.
我们要去趟古巴We're going to Cuba.
古巴  哈瓦那
五美元5 bucks.
-才这点钱  -是- That's it, huh? - Si?
同样修剪一下  在罗马要花30美元呢Same thing cost me $30 in Rome.

所以我不确定他是否会对So I'm not sure how interested he'll be
我对斯凯的发现感兴趣in what I found out about Skye.
斯凯Skye?
我或许不该跟你说这个I probably shouldn't be talking to you about this.
