神盾局特工第一季 第十二集By aBu 201705
漫威《神盾局特工》前情回顾Previously on "Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."...
你死了好几天You were dead for... days.
我是想死的I wanted to die.
我们也该让你死And we should have let you.
我们给了你一段美好的记忆We gave you a pleasant memory
只记得一座美丽的小岛of a beautiful island.
你没进过神盾局学院嘛You spent no time at the academy.
我没上过你们的神盾魔法学院I didn't go to your S.H.I.E.L.D. Hogwarts or whatever.
084代表...And an 0-8-4 is...?
来源不明的物体  跟你挺像的An object of unknown origin. Kind of like you.
斯凯在追查Skye's trying to I.D. the agent
把她送去孤儿院的特工that dropped her off at the orphanage.
我们说好不让她知道真相We agreed to protect her from the truth.
你必须想清楚你为什么在这里You have to decide why you're here.
你要是无法抛开你的个人牵挂If you can't put aside your personal attachments,
那你就不该在这里then you shouldn't be here.
关于冯·诺依曼的熵的问题我完全答错了I completely blew the question on Von Neumann's entropy.
该死的热力学Freaking thermodynamics.
考试结束了  凯丽  别提了Test's over, Callie. Just let it go.
你说的倒是轻巧Yeah, that's easy for you to say.
你大概拿了高分You probably aced it.
你需要散散心What you need is a little distraction.
这个就够我散心了This will distract me just fine.
随你便All right, well, suit yourself.
来嘛  凯丽  放松一下Come on, Callie! Live a little!
你在等什么What are you waiting for?
凯丽  放松Callie, relax.
就是  我们该放松一下了Yes, we earn it.
来吧  凯丽  一起嗨Come on, have some fun, Callie.
脱掉  脱掉Come on, take it off.
伙计们Guys...
快出来get out.
我们来这里他们不能惩罚我们They can't bust us for coming in here!
快出来Get out now!
不  把我拽出来No! Get it off me!
-赛斯  使劲拉  -我来拉- Seth, pull! Come on. - I'm trying!
我的腿My leg!
把我弄出来Get it off me!
这太令人不安了There is nothing more unsettling,
毫不知情地卷入了如此糟糕的事  being a part of something so horrible, completely unaware.
学员差点死掉The cadet could have died.
那个设想是我们多年前提出的We drew up those concepts years ago.
我们又不知道会被这样应用We didn't know they'd be applied in that way.
是在说冻住的泳池里找到的装置吗Is this the device they found in the frozen pool?
准确地说  是顷刻间冻住的室内泳池Correction -- the instantly frozen indoor pool.
看起来是几天前放进过滤器的It seems like it was planted in the filter days before,
像是有人在针对这几个学员like someone was waiting for those specific cadets.
总之  他们认为Well, as far as they can tell,
这个装置使用了她设计的晶体核化过程the device uses a crystalline nucleation process she designed.
和他发明的递送机制And a delivery mechanism he invented.
所以才会要我们去就这个案子提供专业意见That's why we're being asked to consult on the investigation.
那么我们要去"神盾学院"咯So we're going to the academy?
是科技部Science and technology division.
发生的事让学员们很受震动Cadets are pretty shaken up over what happened.
韦弗特工想让你们给学生们讲讲Agent Weaver asked if you two could speak to the student body
潜力的威胁性  安定人心about potentiality to calm them down.
当然  潜力演讲Of course. The talk.
我们都听过We've all heard the talk.
-我没听过  -你会听到的- I haven't.  - I guess you will.
对这个"神盾局学院"我可是如雷贯耳Well, I've heard a lot about the academy.
终于能亲眼看看  好激动I'm excited to finally see it.
我也是  从没去过科技部呢Me, too. Never been to sci-tech before.
从没去过吗Never? Huh.
神盾局的不同学院分部之间不来往吗The different S.H.I.E.L.D. Academies don't interact?
来往不多Not much.
通讯学院跟其他分部来往比较多Academy of communications does,
但他们是最大的  专注于数据分析but they're the biggest and focused on data analysis.
-无聊  -最容易考进的分部- Boring. - It's the easiest to get into.
你要是进了  就是那个学院的  斯凯That's where you'd be, Skye.
谢了Thanks.
作战部是最严苛的分部Operations is the most aggressive program.
淘汰率比其他任何一个分部都多More people wash out of operations than the other academies.
哪个分部最难进So which one's the hardest to get into?
科技部和作战部似乎有些不合啊I'm picking up on the rivalry between sciences and operations.
你和科尔森已经不计较那些了Are you and Coulson past all that,
还是打算帮沃德偷他们的吉祥物呀or you gonna help Ward steal their mascot?
我们不去  送你们到学院后We're not going. After we drop you off,
科尔森和我有别的事要做Coulson and I have other matters to attend to.
科尔森好久没出办公室了Coulson hasn't come out of his office in awhile.
你们说他还好吗Do you think he's all right?
他现在处于低谷  这种事对谁都不容易We saw him at a low. It's not easy for anybody.
但科尔森很坚强But Coulson's tough as they come.
他会没事的  给他点时间He'll be good. Just give him time.
在他收拾心情时And while he takes that time,
就靠我们查明学院的事了it's on us to figure out what's going on at the academy.
这里在神盾局成立前就隶属于SSRThis was the SSR facility before S.H.I.E.L.D. was even founded.
神盾学院  科技部
SSR就是..."SSR" stands for --
战略科学军团  我知道Strategic Scientific Reserve. Yeah, I know.
你们就是在这里拿到博士学位的吗Is this where you got all your PhDs?
不  至少要有一个博士学位才进得来Oh, no, you need at least one to get through the door.
科技部跟你想象的一样吗  沃德特工Is science and technology what you imagined, Agent Ward?
是啊  不穿军服  没有绳网Yep -- no uniforms, no rope course,
也没有发达的肌肉no defined muscularity on anyone.
不用齐步走  也没有智商两位数的人No marching in place, no I.Q.s in double digits.
你们来了  很高兴见到你There they are. So good to see you.
你还是这么美You look as lovely as ever.
同意I concur.
谢谢Thank you.
沃德特工  很高兴你能来  长官Agent Ward. Pleasure to have you, sir.
韦弗特工Agent Weaver.
有嫌疑人名单了吗There's a list of suspects?
基于研制出我们找到的那个设备Based on the level of intelligence it would take to put a device
所需的智力水平together like the one we found,
我们已将范围缩小到排名前10%的学员we've narrowed it down to the top 10% of our cadets.
恐怕其中有颗"老鼠屎"I'm worried there's a bad seed.
作战部和科学部不尽相同Ops and sciences have differences,
但都要小心所谓的"老鼠屎"but both have to be careful about what we call "bad seeds",
就是指那些想用我们给的工具来...people who want to use the tools we give them for --
"老鼠屎"不是神盾局专用术语  沃德"Bad seed" isn't a S.H.I.E.L.D. term, Ward,
普通人也用just a term.
我知道你已经盘问过受害人I know you've already questioned the victim,
但我有些问题想亲自问他but I have a few questions I'd like to ask him myself.
等赛斯·多默下课了我会安排你们谈谈I'll arrange for you to talk to Seth Dormer when he's out of class.
容我失陪一下Now, if you'll excuse me,
我要带菲兹和西蒙斯特工去演讲厅I'd like to get Agent Fitz and Simmons settled into the lecture hall.
瞧瞧他们Look at them --
这么受欢迎the popular kids.
谁想得到呢Who knew?
我想得到I did.
走吧Come on.
既然我们有空While we have a minute,
带你去看点东西I think there's something you'll want to see.
英勇墙The Wall of Valor.
看来你有所耳闻So you've read about it?
每处神盾局设施都有一面纪念墙Every S.H.I.E.L.D. facility has a memorial
刻着在任务中牺牲的特工to the agents lost in the line of duty.
神盾局的历史就刻在这样的墙上S.H.I.E.L.D.'s history can be traced on walls like this.
巴基·巴恩斯"Bucky" Barnes.
美队老友  《美国队长:复仇者先锋》中坠下山崖  第二部作为冬兵出现
这让我们能正确审视我们的职责Puts it in perspective -- what we do.
你们一定很骄傲吧Must make you guys proud --
这么辉煌的历史all this history.
真希望我也是其中一员Just wish I was a part of it.
我不是自怜自哀It's not self-pity, really.
这里的每个人都是凭实力和努力进来的I'm just saying everyone here has earned this.
这是他们应得的They deserve it.
我是靠电脑入侵进来的I hacked my way in --
感觉像作弊了一样feels like I cheated.
要加入我们只需一颗献身大义的心All you need to join is a dedication to the greater good.
科尔森一见到你就看出你有这品质Coulson saw that in you the moment he met you.
你得把那些文件收起来You have got to put that away.
怎么能  你也看过了How can I? You read it.
而你还在反复地看And you haven't stopped reading it.
我就是想不通I just can't get my head around it.
我记得当时的事  那种锥心的痛I remember what happened -- the pain --
但我也记得塔希提岛...but I also remember Tahiti. It's --
这份文件里的就是真相What's in that file -- it's the truth.
谁说的Says who?
弗瑞局长Director Fury.
如果我不问  他就会瞒着我If I hadn't asked, he'd have kept it from me,
不让我知道kept me from knowing.
现在你知道了  感觉好些吗And now that you know, you feel better?
收起来吧Put it away.
要告诉我为什么要去墨西哥城吗You want to tell me why we're flying to Mexico City?
让你忙点别的事To get your head working on something else.
我照你说的一直在调查斯凯的过去I've been looking into Skye's past, like you asked,
以及把她送去孤儿院的那名特工into the agent who dropped her off at the orphanage.
艾弗里特工  她遇害了Agent Avery. She was killed.
但她的搭档还活着  他消失了But her partner wasn't. He disappeared.
理查德·拉姆利Richard Lumley.
23年前  就在艾弗里死后那一天失踪了Went off-grid 23 years ago, day after Avery was crossed off.
他又出现了He's resurfaced?
几天前  一个墨西哥少年A few days ago, a Mexican teenager
在脸书上传了一张自拍posted a selfie on his facebook page --
照片背景里  拉姆利正走出一间杂货店managed to capture our guy leaving a grocery store in the background.
如果他这些年一直成功躲开了神盾局If he's good enough to avoid S.H.I.E.L.D. all these years,
他会发现的He'll know.
而且会有所行动And he'll be on the move.
我们只有一个极小的机会拦住他We have a short window to intercept.
他可能杀害了艾弗里特工He may have killed agent Avery.
或者是想避免相同的命运or wanted to avoid the same fate.
找到他  就真相大白了Find him, we find out.
我们还要多久着陆How long till we touch down?
40分钟  我去给车加满油40 minutes. I'll gas the car.
今天  我们很自豪地邀请到Today, we're proud to welcome back
两名神盾局学院最出色的学生two of S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy's finest,
至今最年轻的毕业生our youngest graduates to date.
名字你们都知道You know their names.
让我们一起欢迎利奥波德·菲兹特工Please join me in welcoming Agent Leopold Fitz
和珍玛·西蒙斯特工and agent Jemma Simmons.
谢谢  韦弗特工Thank you, agent Weaver.
很高兴能回到这里It's nice to be back.
很遗憾  是在这种情况下Unfortunately, it has to be under these circumstances.
如果你还不了解神盾局的历史If you don't know the history of S.H.I.E.L.D. by now,
这没有任何借口there's no excuse...
除非你在沃恩教授的课上睡着了Unless you fell asleep in professor Vaughn's class --
这是完全可以接受的借口that's a perfectly acceptable excuse.
作为科学家  我们本能地向前发展Our instinct as scientists is to move forward,
迅速前进  挑战极限advance quickly, push the envelope.
但鉴于最近发生的事But given recent events,
也应该回首过往it makes sense to reflect back on our history.
你想不到任何原因And you can't think of any reason
会有尖子生要伤害你吗a top student would want to go after you?
想不到  尖子生都是我的朋友No. Um, the top students are my friends.
这里竞争虽激烈It's competitive here,
但我们通常不会想办法除掉对方but we usually don't resort to knocking each other off.
无意冒犯  但这里不是作战部This isn't operations -- no offense.
没事None taken.
这些人对你都算友好吗All these names you would consider friendly?
多尼·吉尔算不上Not Donnie Gill.
我对他几乎一无所知  他不和别人说话I barely know the kid. He doesn't talk to anyone.
当时他也在游泳池边And he was at the pool.
在那里学习  但我不觉得是他做的Studying, but I don't think he's the guy.
他只是和智商低于170的人交流有点困难He just has trouble communicating with anyone below a 170 I.Q.
神盾局是在战略科学军团打败了And S.H.I.E.L.D. was founded after the SSR was able to
所向披靡的九头蛇军团后成立的defeat the nearly indomitable force known as Hydra.
我们往往会忘记这些组织We tend to forget that these organizations --
九头蛇  蜈蚣  尖端创意科技Hydra, Centipede, A.I.M. --
《钢铁侠3》中的反派公司
都是由极其杰出的科学家组成的were also made up of extremely brilliant scientists,
他们是和你我一样Men and women who started with
有着无限潜力的男男女女the same unlimited potential as you or I.
潜力有时候很危险Potential can sometimes be dangerous.
钚有给一个城市供能的潜力Plutonium has the potential to power a city
但也可被用于制造核弹or to be a nuclear bomb.
今天  我们想跟大家分享几个外勤任务故事Today, we'd like to share a few stories from the field
这些亲身经历让我们深刻地认识到了这一点in which we learned this lesson up close
也亲眼看到未经检验的科技和生物技术and faced the consequences when untested technology
落入敌手的后果or biology lands in the wrong hands.
别担心  我们带了图片And don't worry -- we brought pictures.
天啊Oh, god.
天啊Oh, god!
这是怎么回事What is this?!
发生什么事了  帮帮我Hey, what's happening to me?! Help me!
救命  把它弄掉Help me! Get it off!
让它停下来Make it stop!
帮我把它弄掉  不  让它停下Help me get it off! No! Make it stop!
找一处裸露的皮肤Find exposed skin.
得给他注射葡萄糖来提高身体的自然凝固点He needs glucose to raise his body's natural freezing point.
西蒙斯  我需要工具把冰敲开Simmons, I need something to break the ice.
珍玛Jemma.
-准备好了吗  -好了- Ready? - Yeah.
菲兹  什么情况Fitz, talk to me.
有什么东西把他弄成这样  快找出来Something's doing this to him. Find it.
沃德  在那里  菲兹  我们怎么做Ward, there it is. Fitz, What now?
砸了那东西Smash the damn thing!
没事了  没事了It's okay. It's okay.
没事了  没事了  都结束了It's okay. It's okay. It's over.
奎恩国际股价飙升
我不想听失败的借口I don't want to hear excuses why it didn't work.
这种事有专人替我做I have people who do that for me.
我只要你在我赶到之前处理好I just want you to take care of it before I arrive.
记住这对我们双方都有很大的好处Just keep in mind how much this will benefit us both, yeah?
奎恩先生  飞机已经在等您了Mr. Quinn, plane's waiting for you, sir.
你想不到这里有谁会伤害你吗And you can't think of anyone here who'd want to hurt you?
我谁都不认识I don't know anyone.
多尼  我要找人送你回房去了Donnie, I'm gonna have you escorted back to your room.
好好休息  注意保暖You get some rest and stay warm.
抱歉搞砸了你们的演讲Sorry I ruined your lecture.
我真的很期待来着I was really looking forward to it.
不是你的错  多尼It's not your fault, Donnie.
那个设备上没发现任何遗传物质或指纹No genetic materials or prints found on the device.
设备组件很罕见  而且非常昂贵The components are rare and expensive.
新生恶作剧虽是这里的传统Freshman pranks are tradition,
但这绝没那么简单but these are something else.
是谋杀未遂Attempted murder.
那么说多尼才是目标吗So, Donnie was the intended target all along?
他跟在游泳池出事的学员有什么共同之处吗He have anything in common with the cadets at the pool?
-那些孩子很受欢迎  多尼  -不受欢迎- These kids were popular. Donnie was... - Not.
多尼在这里没有树敌Donnie hadn't made any enemies here,
但也没交到朋友but he hadn't made any friends, either.
他很难适应这里吗  他多大了He had a hard time adjusting? How old is he?
18岁  是你们之后最年轻的的学员18, youngest since you guys.
智商190  我们遇见他时  他高中缀学190 I.Q. And failing out of high school when we met him.
可能是觉得高中太无聊Probably bored out of his mind.
一切顺利的话  我们本考虑让他提前毕业If things went well, we were considering graduating him early
派他去沙箱基地and assigning him to the Sandbox.
他肯定会喜欢那里的Well, he would love it there.
但他不喜欢这里  所以我担心他会被淘汰But he doesn'tike it here, so I'm afraid he'll wash out.
可能就是想这样Maybe that was the idea.
韦弗特工  继续调查Agent Weaver, keep working with investigations --
找学员和教员谈话interviewing cadets, instructors.
没问题Of course.
我们呢And us?
他们找人谈话不会有收获的Their interviews won't bear fruit.
这里就教学员怎么保守秘密We teach cadets to keep secrets.
以前你们想躲开老师Where did you guys hang out
通常会去哪when you wanted to get away from the faculty?
这事能跟作战部的人说吗Can we tell someone from operations?
当然  因为我们得自己去调查Yes, because we need to conduct our own investigation.
墨西哥  墨西哥城
达里奥·马尔克斯服装店Dario Marquez's dress shop.
马尔克斯的伪证虽不是城里最好的Marquez doesn't do the best papers in town,
但他可以不用电脑but he also doesn't use a computer.
那么如果拉姆利要逃跑So, if Lumley's gonna make a run for it,
你猜他可能会去找他your guess is he might pass through that door.
值得一试It's worth a shot,
我们守株待兔so we wait.
等我们到了呢And when we get there?
低调点  混进去We mingle, low key.
你和斯凯跟学生混熟You and Skye get comfortable with the students --
看看能不能打听到八卦see if you can get them gossiping.
斯凯看上去挺年轻  混进去不成问题Skye looks young enough to blend in.
你也没那么老啊You're not exactly old man river,
而且菲兹看上去比我们还小了and Fitz looks younger than us.
总有一天你会没法拿这个取笑我Time will come when you won't make fun of me for that.
到时候你就嫉妒吧You'll be jealous.
带着一脸褶子嫉妒我You'll be jealous, wrinkly old hags.
菲兹  你去跟多尼谈谈吧I want Fitz to go talk to Donnie.
什么Sorry?
多尼性格内向  他可能有事没说Donnie's withdrawn, might know more than he's letting on.
你是这里的英雄  菲兹  他很敬佩你You're a hero here, Fitz. He looks up to you.
你去跟他聊聊Go hang out with him.
即使他不知道是谁想害他Even if he has no clue who might be after him,
有个朋友聊聊也好he could use a friend.
这个主意真是太棒了That is a wonderful idea.
沃德偶尔也能想出好主意Ward has them from time to time.
我先走了  回见I'll meet you later.
怎么了  派他去是战略需要What? It's strategic.
你做得很好It's adorable.
看来铁皮人是有心的呢The tin man has a heart after all.
话说我们去哪里So, where are we going?
神盾局对内一直是严格监管S.H.I.E.L.D. keeps careful watch of everything within their walls,
所以60年代末so in the late '60s,
为了逃避摄像头和教职工的窥探to escape the cameras and the prying eyes of the faculty,
几个学员开始偷溜去锅炉房a few cadets started sneaking down to the boiler room
打牌  交流思想to play cards, you know, exchange ideas.
跟我很像My kind of people.
一些惊人的突破就发源于这里Some amazing breakthroughs have come out of here.
所以传统延续了下来So the tradition lives on.
大家一起窝在锅炉房吗Of cramming into the boiler room?
这些年来  我们做了些改进Well, over the years, we made a few improvements.
你们作战部那边有类似的地方吗Do you have one of these at operations?
没有No.
不出所料Did not think so.
喝酒的话我请Drinks are on me.
多尼Donnie.
菲兹特工  长官Agent Fitz, sir.
别这样  叫我菲兹就行Oh, please. Call me "Fitz."
我可以进去吗Mind if I come in?
当然  不  我是说不介意Yeah -- no. I mean, no, I don't.
我以前的房间跟这一模一样  但是Okay, my room was just like this, except, um,
地上有更多的脏衣服um, there was a lot more laundry on the floor.
你好点了吗You feeling better?
如果你觉得有人在针对你You know, you shouldn't be afraid to tell me
你可以大胆跟我说的if you think someone could be targeting you.
我不是害怕  大概只是个恶作剧I'm not. It was -- it was probably just a prank.
新生总会被捉弄Freshmen get pranked.
这我记忆犹新I remember vividly,
但也不是每个新生都会被冻成冰雕吧but that doesn't mean that every freshman needs to be thawed.
那是有机发光二极管的设计图吗Is that a design for organic light-emitting diodes?
我觉得可以用于动态伪装For active camouflage, I'm thinking.
离子空气炮An ionized air cannon?
真小巧It's so small.
我将增压装置增加了一倍  是通过Well, I was able to double the pressurization by making --
紧凑排列By making it compact.
真聪明Clever.
我得承认  你这些创意I must say -- these ideas are way beyond
比我当年刚入学时强多了what I was toying with in my first few months.
你不该藏着掖着You shouldn't keep these big ideas to yourself.
你该拿给你的导师看You should run them by your instructors.
这些还不算什么These aren't my big ideas.
如果说你要像这人一样So...say you're gonna do what this guy did --
离开神盾局  销声匿迹Leave S.H.I.E.L.D., go off the grid.
你会怎么做What's your move?
我会藏在一架从纽瓦克到新加坡的I'd hide in the wheel well of a 747 flight
波音747的轮舱内from Newark to Singapore.
备好氧气瓶  降落伞Oxygen, a chute.
最后一半旅程将经过三千英里的土地The back half of the trip passes over 3,000 miles of land,
有十几个国家供我选择降落a dozen countries -- could drop anywhere.
你大概会去南美吧You'd probably head to South America.
你会说西班牙语You speak Spanish.
不会说多少Vacation spanish.
不如利马吧  那儿的美食真不错Lima, most likely, what with the growing food scene.
好了  你这是干什么All right, what's up?
你说呢You tell me.
你从没像今天这么多话You're talking, more than ever.
因为你太安静了'Cause you're not.
还突然对斯凯的调查有了兴趣And you suddenly became active on the Skye investigation?
她证明了自己She's proved herself --
为了团队  为了你  出了很大力stepped up in a big way -- for our team, for you.
是这样吗  还是想分散我的注意力Is that it, or is it just to distract me?
二者皆有Both.
我知道你很难接受...I know you're having a hard time believing what --
他们篡改了我的记忆They changed my memories.
谁能说他们没篡改别的呢Who's to say they didn't change more?
我能说I say.
我了解你  菲尔  你我相识已久I know you, Phil, and I knew you before.
你该知道如果我对这事有一丝怀疑You'd know I'd be the first to go down that road
我一定会追查到底If I thought it led somewhere.
你至少还相信我吧Do you believe me, at least?
-你相信我吗  -是的- Do you -- - Yes.
那就好Good.
但我厌倦了秘密  所以我很高兴能来这里But I'm tired of secrets, so I'm glad we're here.
我们要揭开所有的秘密We need to root out all the secrets.
沃德特工和我在上床...Agent Ward and I have been having sex --
我发现他了I got him.
他朝你那边走去了He's headed your way.
看起来他想往小巷里走Looks like he's heading down the alley.
我是神盾局的科尔森特工I'm Agent Coulson, with S.H.I.E.L.D.
上帝保佑Oh, thank god.
是关于那个小女孩  是吗It's about the baby girl, isn't it?
氰化物Cyanide?
你以为我们要对你做什么What did you think we were gonna do to you?
他们对她做的事What they did to her.
琳达·艾弗里特工吗Agent Linda Avery?
她不是第一个死去的人She wasn't the first one to die.
我们当时正往中国湖南省赶去We were headed into the Hunan Province of China.
收到了一名高级特工发来的084任务A senior agent had called in an 0-8-4.
来源不明的物体An object of unknown origin.
我们也接过这种任务We've dealt with those before.
他说整个村子的人为了保护这个084而死He said the entire village had died trying to protect this one.
艾弗里和我刚从学院毕业Avery and I were just fresh out of the academy.
当时我们五个人作后方支援And there was five of us just running the back end,
直到我们失去了与第一小队的联络until we lost communication with the first team.
我们四处搜寻We went searching.
终于在一座桥下发现了那名高级特工We found the senior agent under a bridge.
他脖子上中了一枪  勉强逃了出来He -- he managed to escape with a gunshot wound to the neck,
但还是失血过多而亡But he bled out.
他死时还紧紧抱着那个084He was still holding on to the 0-8-4.
可怜的小家伙全身是血Poor thing was covered in blood.
我们以为她也死了We thought she was dead, too,
但她只是在那名死去特工的怀里睡着了But sh-- she was just asleep in the dead agent's arms.
那个婴儿I -- The baby?
她就是084吗The girl was the 0-8-4?
就算她有超能力  我们也没见过If she had powers or something, we never witnessed it.
我们五个乘直升机送完那孩子就回去了The five of us helicoptered the kid off, headed home.
降落之后  我们开始被清理After we landed, we started getting crossed off.
处决吗Executed?
逼供  打爆头Tortured, heads bashed in.
轮到艾弗里和我时And when it came down to Avery and I,
我们意识到想让我们的人和那孩子we realized the only way to keep our people
免受追杀的唯一方法and the kid from being hunted --
就是抹去她的存在Was to erase her from existence.
艾弗里很聪明Avery was smart.
她用带头特工的证件伪造了一个八级权限she used the lead agent's credentials to fake a level 8 clearance,
她建立了一个几乎不会被发现的程序she set up a nearly invisible protocol.
寄养系统受命The foster system was ordered
每隔几个月就转移那孩子to move the child around every few months.
但他们还是找到了艾弗里But they still got to Avery.
为了保护这个秘密她死了She died protecting that secret.
-而你离开了  -我离开了一切- And you left town. - Oh, I left everything.
杀死那孩子家人I mean, whoever killed that kid's family
