我们在90年代一起出过任务We ran a few ops together in the '90s.
足智多谋Smart, resourceful.
喜欢特吕弗的电影Had a soft spot for Truffaut movies.
好话不要说太多Easy there, charm school.
根据这些档案  谢恩特工可能是我妈妈According to these files, Agent Shane could be my mom.
即便她是送你去孤儿院的特工Even if shane was the Agent who dropped you off at the orphanage,
也不代表她就是你母亲it doesn't mean she's your mother.
我在查看我出生时所有在职的女特工I started looking into all the female agents active when I was born.
海里捞针  我知道Needle, haystack, I know.
但我把年龄和婚姻状况考虑在内But then I factored in age and marital status,
然后做了个程序来缩小范围and then I built a program to narrow down the field.
那你还是要查很久You're still looking at a long road.
如果我能读取更多文件就会快多了Well, it would be a lot shorter if I could access more files.
或许你可以解除对我的网络监控Maybe you could remove my internet nanny?
我是说我的追踪手镯I'm talking about my tracking bracelet.
我知道I got that.
-那么你会拿掉吗  -不会- So you'll take it off.  - No.
不过我让梅But I asked May to look
查看局里更为保密的文件了into S.H.I.E.L.D.'s more restricted files.

早八点At 0800 hours,
三人潜入海文沃斯联邦监狱three men infiltrated the Havenworth Federal Penitentiary.
潜入吗  是像炮弹一样撞进去了吧Infiltrated? More like cannonballed.
他们在两分钟内进出They were in and out in less then two minutes.
现场没有留下指纹  但我们有一条线索Left no prints at the scene, but we do have one lead.
蜈蚣Centipede.
看来他们设法挽救了一些香港的研究Seems they salvaged some of their research from hong kong.
那么我们想得没错So we were right.

现在他们可以放心制造超级战士  不用担心会爆炸Now they can create super soldiers with no fear of explosion.
你还是别表现得那么激动吧Maybe don't get so excited about it.
我们已毁了两座蜈蚣实验室Two of centipede's labs have been destroyed,
但总有新的出现but they keep popping back up.
现在他们手上至少有三个超级战士  也许更多Now they have at least three of these guys, maybe more.
他们把谁带走了Who did they break out?

擅长策略和快速反应expert in tactics and rapid response.
08年下落不明He fell off the grid in '08,
18个月前出现在波士顿一家餐馆reappeared 18 months ago at a diner in Boston.
他在那里把一个人的眼睛戳瞎了Where he stabbed a friend's eyes out.
用一把牛排刀  然后继续用餐With a steak knife, then finished his meal.
奇怪  波看起来不像个疯子That's funny. Po doesn't look crazy.
开个玩笑  那人长了张嫌疑犯脸I'm kidding. The guy is a walking mug shot.
追捕到他应该不太难Which means he shouldn't be too hard to track down.
找到波和这些蜈蚣战士Finding Po and these centipede soldiers
是神盾局的首要任务is a top priority for S.H.I.E.L.D.
我们会负责行动  但会有帮手We'll be running point, but we won't be working alone.
总部派了哪只小队做后援What team did HQ send for backup?
不是小队  而是一个人Not a team -- a person,

科尔森特工Agent Coulson?
彼得森先生Mr. Peterson,
你能把推土机搬回原位吗if you could put that bulldozer back where you found it...
你得穿上制服跟我走We need you to suit up.
这是个坏主意This is a bad idea.
趁你现在心情好While I have you in a good mood,
我先告诉你  斯凯在追查you should know that Skye's trying to I.D. the agent
把她送去孤儿院的特工that dropped her off at the orphanage.
我们说好不让她知道真相We agreed to protect her from the truth,

她可能会来找你She may come to you.
你能不能一次只犯一个错误One mistake at a time.
科尔森特工  梅特工Agent Coulson, Agent May.
你们上次遇见时  你把她甩到了砖墙上Last time you saw her, you threw her into a brick wall.
是啊Right.
上次的事  我不想做那种人First time around, I wasn't who I wanted to be,
但现在我明白了but now I get it.
有这些超能力是我的荣幸Having all this -- it's a privilege.
受训成为一名特工  和神盾局合作And training to be an agent, working with S.H.I.E.L.D.,
是我在努力做到更好  成为更好的人it's me trying to do better, trying to be better.
我只需要你给我一次机会I just need you to give me a shot.
每个人都该得到第二次机会Everyone deserves a second chance.
但我先说清楚But let me be clear --
不会再有第三次了there will not be a third.
明白  长官Understood, sir.
很好Good.
一点也不好It's not good... at all.
那家伙是个实打实的定时人肉炸弹The guy was a ticking time bomb -- literally.
如果他还那么不稳定  总部不会派他来的HQ wouldn't have sent him if he was still combustible.
他们一定找到了办法稳定他的状态They must have found a way to stabilize him somehow.
他们也能稳定他的态度吗They stabilize his attitude?
上次在联合车站  他对我们充满敌意Cause he was pretty hostile in union station.

话不好听  不过没错Not cool, but true.
别担心麦克  他是个好人And don't worry about Mike. He's a good guy.
他还参与了蜈蚣计划Who's been in the centipede program.
-没错  他能提供超能力支援  -没错- Exactly. He can give us some superpower backup. - Yeah.
我只是想说  这很可能会出岔子Just saying, this could easily go sideways.
我们上次见到他的时候I mean, the last time we saw this guy,
他是个杀气腾腾的疯子he was a raging homicidal maniac --
他就站在我后面  是吗He's standing right behind me, isn't he?
彼得森先生  这位是格兰特·沃德特工Mr. Peterson, this is Agent Grant Ward.
就是他在联合车站击中了你He's the man who shot you at union station.
菲兹-西蒙斯发明了他用的那个武器Fitz-Simmons designed the weapon he used,
我想你应该还记得...and I think you remember --
被绑架的那个Kidnap victim.
你加入了神盾局You joined S.H.I.E.L.D.?
是啊  现在看来  这些政府人员也不赖Yeah. Turns out, guys in suits -- not so bad.
我知道联合车站的事完全可能是另一种结局Look, I know union station could have gone another way.
换了别的队伍或许不会留我一命Another team might not have let me out of there alive.
我欠你们所有人的I owe you -- all off you.
过去的事都过去了That's bygones and water under a distant bridge far away.
你儿子还好吗How's your son?
还在和我姐姐生活Still with my sister.
他以为我在建筑工地上班He thinks I'm working construction,
但过得挺不错  很开心But he's good, happy.
掌握什么情况了So, what do we have?
波方面进展不大Not much on Po.
我查了他之前的住址I checked his previously known addresses
和一些部队旧友  没有发现and old military contacts -- came up empty.
我们一直在找波出来后可能去的地方We've been looking for where Po might be on the outside.
我们也关注一下他在里面的生活Let's look at his life on the inside -- at the prison.
看看能不能理出一些头绪See if that gets us any leads.

回来之后就消失了then fell of the radar when he got back.

你和我去找她谈谈You and I will go talk to her.
让梅把目的地设为克利夫兰Have May set a course for Cleveland.

没关系  我早就习惯了Oh, no, it's okay. I'm used to it.

能赶上她下课We'll catch her on her way out.
一门关于女人的课Whole class... on women.
在以前  你只能自己去琢磨Time was, you just had to figure them out.
解决难题的过程是乐趣的一半所在Solving the puzzle was half the fun.
你当年解决过很多难题吗You solve a lot of puzzles in your day?
有一些吧A few.
有些比其他的更值得Some more worth it than others.
有一个...尤其值得One was...especially rewarding.
发生了什么What happened?
我死了I died.
我猜她没有七级权限吧  长官I guess she wasn't level 7, sir?
她是一位大提琴演奏家She was a cellist,
第二大提琴手second chair,
在波特兰交响乐团Portland Symphony.
只要我在那边就会去看她的演出Saw her play whenever I was in town.

我很遗憾  长官I'm sorry, sir.
我死了好几个月I was gone for months.
复仇者们以为我死了The avengers thought I was dead,
所以我还得保密...神盾局章程so I had to keep that up -- S.H.I.E.L.D. protocol.
或许这样更好It's probably better this way.
也许让她加入组织...Maybe if she'd been part of the agency...
以我的经验  那就是自找麻烦In my experience, that's just asking for trouble.
科尔森告诉我你会帮我Coulson told me you were helping to, you know,
找我失踪已久的父母  谢谢你了find my long-lost folks, so thanks.

你就为这个叫我来吗Is this why you called me here?
不是No.
我是等你来的时候才弄这些的I was just working on this while I waited for you.
我叫你来  是因为关于波有发现Uh, I called 'cause I found something about Po.
说吧Show me.
波服刑期间只有过一名访客  她Po only had one visitor during his prison stint -- her.
注意到她的衣服了吗You notice the outfit?
迈尔斯说是一个穿花裙子的女人Miles said a girl in a flower dress
让他黑进神盾局的asked him to hack S.H.I.E.L.D.
或许就是她This could be the same girl.
能听到对话内容吗Can we hear the conversation?
扫兴的就是这一点That's the bummer --
没有音频  不过也不是毫无办法there was no audio, but it's not a total loss.
我用了神盾局的唇语程序I was able to use S.H.I.E.L.D.'s lip-reading program,
因为我们刚好有一个because we have one of those.
对那女的没用It didn't work on the girl
因为她一直没抬头看摄像头because she never looks up at the camera,
但对波管用  捕捉到了一句but Po did -- once -- and it caught this.
千里眼不喜欢被人联系The clairvoyant does not like to be touched.
我写了下来I wrote that down,
这样我们就再不用听第二遍了so we don't have to hear that again -- ever.

你有印象吗Does that mean anything to you?
但这对他们挺重要But it means something to them --
波和那个神秘女to Po and whoever that woman is.
她叫蕾娜Her name's Raina.

很高兴又能自己切肉了Nice to cut my own meat again.
牛排还合你口味吗The steak was to your liking?
煎得太老  而且周围环境也...Overcooked, and the ambience...
我们来这儿可不是因为装修好We're not here for the decor.
我们已经稳定了血清  增加了植入物We've stabilized the serum, added the implant,
现在我们需要千里眼帮我们and now we need the clairvoyant's help
找到实施第三阶段的关键in finding the key to stage three.
我之前已经问过他了I've asked before.
千里眼在找寻你的目标人物The clairvoyant has trouble seeing

让我烦的是这个This what's upsetting me.
这支神盾局小队摧毁了我们两个指挥部This S.H.I.E.L.D. teams has destroyed two of our operations.
安全起见我们现在隔几天就换个地方We move every few days now to be safe.
这对我们的维护问题是个挑战Which causes challenges for our maintenance problems.
这种情况对战士的损害很大We can't overstate the toll this takes on our soldiers.
每次完成任务后  他们都筋疲力尽They are drained after every mission.
我们的人需要定期注射  经常保养Our men need regular injections, constant upkeep.
神盾局一直追赶我们  这些就会有困难Difficult when S.H.I.E.L.D. has us on the run.
那我们就该停止逃跑了Then it's time to stop running.
我们在系统里搜索她We're running her through our systems.
也许能查到她的身份  但我们猜测Maybe we can get an I.D., but we're guessing
她是蜈蚣的征兵人员  而波是她刚招的新兵she's centipede's recruiter and Po's her latest recruit.
三个超级战士从天而降炸开监狱  救他出去Three super soldiers dive-bomb a prison, pluck him out?
那他可真是头号获选新秀He's her number-one draft pick.
但为什么选他But why him?
蜈蚣在制造更多的战士Centipede's making more soldiers.
也许他们想让波去协调他们  领导他们Maybe they want Po to coordinate them, lead them.
他有战术策略背景His background's tactical strategy.
刚好符合要求He fits the bill.
那么  这些人有超级战士So, these guys have super soldiers,
有经验丰富的军事战略家an expert military strategist,
还有一个能预见未来的千里眼and a clairvoyant who can see the future.
还有人想换个队伍吗Anyone else thinking about switching teams?
他们不可能有灵媒They couldn't have a psychic.
名录上一个都没有  那只是传说There are none on the index. They're a myth.
-托尔也是传说呢  -千里眼可能是个化名- So was Thor. - Maybe it's an alias.
在我们数据库里搜索看看有没有线索Run it through our database and see if anything pops up.

根据信号追踪  海沃德的手机Hayward's cellphone has been traced
在离这里约13英里的一家废弃工厂to an abandoned factory about eight miles from here.
那里可能是蜈蚣的新实验室Probably centipede's new lab.
像他们的作风  我们捣毁一家工厂Certainly been there M.O. -- we destroy one factory,
他们就再建一家  让我们回到原点they set up another, putting us back to square one.

我跟彼得森先生从装卸码头进去Mr. Peterson and I will enter through the loading dock.
你们在外面检测控制You'll run the back end from outside.
只有我们吗We're doing this just us?
自从沃德把我从我的货车拉出来We've been playing whack-a-mole with these guys
我们就是打一个冒一窝since Ward first picked me out of my van.
神盾局难道不派人支援我们吗Shouldn't big S.H.I.E.L.D. be sending in backup?
相信我  他们已经派人了Trust me, they already did.
行动吧Let's move.
不要有压力No pressure.
加利福尼亚州  奥克兰
只有我们在这儿吗We alone here?
看来是这样It appears so.
我们只能检测到你们的热信号The only heat signatures we're reading are yours.

心率也在急骤下降Heart rate's plummeting, as well.
长官  他情况不妙Sir, he's in bad shape.
在受伤的情况下如此高强度地打斗Between the physical exertion and this wound,
他的生命体征已经趋近危险值了his vitals are dangerously low.
蜈蚣的背后主使是谁  是谁干的Who's behind centipede? Who's doing this?!
我什么都不会说的I won't say anything.
我发誓I promise.
不要  求求你  不要No! Please! Don't do th--
那是麦克·彼得森  最早的实验对象之一That's Mike Peterson, one of our first subjects.
他有一段时间没注射血清了He hasn't been injected with the serum in awhile,
但他还有能力but he still has his powers.
不  他有你通往第三阶段的钥匙No. What he has is your key to stage three.
左边是阿奇拉·阿玛多尔的The one on the left is Akela Amador's.
右边是海沃德的Hayward's is on the right.
他的假眼有点受损Now, his prosthetic was slightly damaged,
但从数字化改造技术来看but based on digital reconstruction,
我们可以确定这两者的技术完全相同we can now confirm that the technology is virtually identical.
海沃德的假眼跟阿玛多尔的那个Hayward's prosthetic has the same internal power source,
具有相同的内置电源  反向散射功能和生物机械backscatter capabilities, and biomechanics as Amador.
那么眼球植入物也是蜈蚣研发的So centipede also designed the eye implant?
这些人真是什么都会啊These guys are serious multitaskers.
谁是阿奇拉·阿玛多尔Who's Akela Amador?
她以前是神盾局特工Former S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent,
是我们碰到的第一个被植入这种假眼人the first person we encountered with this eye technology,
她是个好特工  但被迫做了坏事a good agent who was forced to do some bad things.
我们帮助了她We helped her.
你们似乎总这么做Kind of a pattern with you guys.
那么仓库里的那些战士So then those soldiers at the warehouse
是因为那假眼而被迫攻击我们的吗were forced to attack us through that eye thing?
他们在接受命令They were getting orders.
我们开始占上风时When the tide turned in our favor,
蜈蚣触发了海沃德的致死开关centipede flipped Hayward's kill switch,
命令其他人逃跑told the other guys to run.
你能像之前那样追踪视频信号Can you track the eye feed like before,
确定他们的位置吗find their location?
不行  阿玛多尔之后他们升了级Nope -- they've upgraded since Amador.
他们的视频信号已经无迹可寻了Their feed's untraceable now.
他们的技术一直在飞快升级Their technology keeps advancing at a disturbingly rapid pace.
他们肯定有用之不竭的人力和资源They must have endless manpower, resources.
还有个阔气的金主And someone with a fat wallet.
波负责战略  蕾娜负责招兵Po's the strategist. Raina's the recruiter.
也许千里眼就是那个金主Perhaps this Clairvoyant's the money.
有道理That makes sense.
如果我能预见未来  我会直接去拉斯维加斯If I could see the future, I'd go straight to Las Vegas.
他们的幕后主使未必有特异功能Whoever's behind them may or may not be psychic,
但他们总比我们快一步but they're one step ahead of us every time.
我得向总部汇报下情况I need to update HQ.
这事比我们想的要严重This is bigger than we thought.
我联系了千里眼I spoke with the Clairvoyant.
然后呢And?
时机到了我自然会告诉你I'll share the information when the time is right.
除了情报  我还想了解别的I would love to hear much more than just information.
你能告诉我他什么样吗Will you... tell me what he's like?
绝对不行Never.
上一个想打听这些的人The last person who tried to learn these things
挨了一刀got a knife for it.
我不想再那么做了  蕾娜I don't want to have to do that again, Raina.
况且你的双眼如此动人You have such pretty eyes.
我明白I understand.
你连小声跟我说说都不行You can't even whisper to me about him.
没错  我不能No, I can't.
但我跟千里眼说起了你But I did tell the Clairvoyant about you.
我们深入地探讨了你的诸多优点Spoke at length about your many virtues.
你真好How sweet.
我给你倒杯威士忌I'll pour you a scotch.
再也  不许  那么做了Don't ever do that again.
那就喝白兰地Brandy, then?
我们执行任务时When we're out in the field,
你要全身心专注于任务  不是我your head needs to be on the op, not on me.
暂停一下Time-out.
有点跟不上你的节奏了Still playing catch-up here.
-你说什么呢  -你居然替我挡拳头- What are you talking about? - You taking a punch for me?
我不需要你保护I don't need your protection.
你以为我不知道吗You think I don't know that?
我替你挡那一拳是因为你比我灵活I took that punch 'cause you're faster than me.
你保持行动力  对任务更有利You could do more good on your feet.
这完全是战术策略  不含情感因素It was tactical, not personal.
那我错怪你了My mistake.
我不是菜鸟新兵  分不清公务和私事I am not some recruit who can't separate church from state.
在这一点上你我是一致的I'm on the same page as you.
别臭美了So don't flatter yourself.
抱歉  我不是有意打扰Sorry. I didn't mean to crash.
什么事What do you want?
又是关于那个闪存盘吗This about that thumb drive again?
不是啊No.
那就好Good.
我知道你不想帮我Look, I get that you don't want to help with that,
你表达得十分明白  声振寰宇  人尽皆知loud and clear, big neon, flashing lights.
但又不是我求的你  科尔森他...But I didn't ask, okay? Coulson --
科尔森不想告诉你事实真相Coulson doesn't want to tell you the truth.
事实就是The truth is...
你必须想清楚你为什么在这里You have to decide why you're here.
我们肩负使命  而这使命不是替你寻亲We have a mission, and it's not to find your parents.
你要是无法抛开你的个人牵挂If you can't put aside your personal attachments,
那你就不该在这里then you shouldn't be here.
请进Oh, come on in.
多谢Thanks.
你恢复得还好吧You doing okay?
恐怕我Afraid I won't be...
接下来几天里是帮不上忙了much good to you for the next couple days.
这可以理解That's understandable.
你在仓库的表现非常优异You went above and beyond at that warehouse,
给了我们有力的协助had our backs more than once.
谢谢你  长官Thank you, sir.
但蜈蚣还逍遥法外But I know Centipede's still out there.
我们依然任重道远Now, we still got a lot of work to do.
没错True.
但据你的监管人员说  训练刻苦是你的专长But according to your S.O., hard work's your specialty.
他说你一刻不停地苦练Said you train 24/7.
我想出类拔萃I want to be the best.
值得敬佩And that's admirable.
但你住进训练场之后  就没离开过But you hadn't left the training facility since you got there,
那么自从联合车站事件之后  你就没见过你儿子which means you haven't seen your son since union station.
艾斯挺好的Ace is fine.
我们经常通话We...we talk all the time.
但你一直没去看他But you haven't been to see him.
为什么Why?
麦克Mike!
因为上一次他看见我的时候Because the last time he saw me...
我是个怪物I was a monster.
都被我儿子看到了My kid saw that.
你待在这里是没法补救的You can't fix that from here.
你躲得远远的  不陪着他And staying away, not being there...
我亲眼见识过I've seen firsthand
这种回避造成的伤害the kind of damage that can do.
我最不想的就是伤害艾斯The last thing I want to do is hurt Ace.
他是我儿子  但He's...he's my son, but...
也许没有我  他会过得更好maybe he's better off without me.
我不这么认为I don't think that's true.
我接受这份工作时  我做出了选择When I took this job, I made a choice,
这里每个人都做了这个选择the same choice everyone else here made --
这份工作高于生活This life over the other one,
高于假日晚宴  家长会和独奏会the one with holiday dinners and PTA meetings, recitals.
这并不容易It's not easy.
但这样一来  当面临艰难选择But if the time comes to make the hard call,
会容易些it's simpler.
但你有个儿子But you have a son.
有人在等你回家You have someone waiting for you to come home.
你要想清楚You need to think about that.
要想想他You need to think about him.
然后再去做决定Before you make your choice.
你好Hello?
艾斯Hey, Ace.
爸爸Dad!
真高兴能听到你的声音  孩子It is so good to hear your voice, buddy.
我有好消息告诉你And I got some good news --
我能回家去看你了I'm gonna get to come home and see you for a bit.
太棒了Awesome!
也许你能见见我的新朋友Then maybe you can meet my new friend.
她说她认识你  她这会儿就在She said she knows you. She's here right now.
艾斯  你和谁一起呢  你明迪姑姑呢Ace, who's there with you? Where's your Aunt Mindy?
你好  麦克Hello, Mike.
记得我和你说过  我能改变你的生活吗Remember when I told you I could change your life?
他们想用艾斯来交换他爸爸They want a trade -- Ace for his father.
他们已经定好了时间地点They've set a time and a place.
该死的野蛮人Bloody savages.
他们想拿他做实验They want to experiment on him,
查明他是如何保存能力的determine how he still has his abilities.
我们要让他们得逞吗And we're gonna let them?
我们之前也打败过他们We've fought these guys before.
我们别无选择We don't have a choice.
他们给了彼得森先生非常明确的指示The instructions they gave Mr. Peterson were very specific.
我打了电话给总部  叫他们停止行动I called HQ, told them to stand down.
-停止行动吗  -那我们就自己解决吧- Stand down? - So we take them alone.
至少该找个人质营救小组来支援行动We should at least have a hostage-rescue unit in support of this.
他们说会杀了我儿子They said they would murder my son.
如果我们走错一步If we make one wrong move.
发现任何电子设备  通讯设备和监视的迹象Any electronics, any comms, any sign of surveillance
他们就会终止这项协议and they'll terminate the arrangement.
我会把自己交出去I'll give myself up,
这不要紧  把他救回来就行no problem, get him back.
之后再想办法I can figure it out from there.
你的身体还在恢复中You're still recovering.
我们不能就这么把你交出去  是吧We can't just hand you over to them like that, can we?
菲兹-西蒙斯有办法用非电子设备追踪他Fitz-Simmons have a non-electronic method of tracking him.
西蒙斯制造了一种无味的气味剂Simmons has fabricated an odorless scent.
我的仪器能探测到它I have an instrument which can detect it.
就像侦探犬一样Works like a bloodhound,
能在50公里外进行追踪can track someone from over 50 kilometers.
交换完成后After we make the trade,
我们就能追踪彼得森先生了we'll be able to follow Mr. Peterson.
为他争取一些时间  让他恢复力量Buy him some time to get his strength back.
我们会找到他的We'll find him.
我不在乎我怎么样  只要我儿子...I don't care what happens to me. As long as my boy is...
我向你保证  我们会把你儿子救回来的I promise you, we're gonna get your son back.
大桥已关闭
至少让我护送他去做交换吧At least let me escort him out for the exchange.
彼得森先生要我陪他Mr. Peterson requested me.
这我没意见  如果情况不妙I'm comfortable with that, and if things go south,
我需要你在这里  带领我们小队I need you back here, taking point on the team.
沃德就位了吗Is Ward in position?
就位了Yes.
但我不喜欢这样But I don't like any of this.
如果你喜欢  才叫有问题呢There'd be something wrong with you if you did.
交换一结束  我就启动我的设备Once the swap happens, I'll fire up my equipment.
不管他们带你去哪  我们都能追踪你We'll be able to track you wherever they take you.
别做什么会伤及我儿子的事Just don't do anything that'll endanger my son.
我们不会的  但我们要确保We won't, but we want to make sure
艾斯的爸爸也不会有事Ace has his dad at the end of the day, too.
该走了Time to go.
我的团队不会让你失望的My team won't let you down.
事情不该是这样的It wasn't supposed to go down like this.
我发誓  我会弥补的I'm gonna make this right, I swear.
该死Damn it.
麦克  有阵子不见了Hello, Mike. It's been awhile.
你儿子真可爱  长得好像你Your son is adorable, and he looks just like you.
我想我们还没见过I don't believe I've had the pleasure.
算你走运Lucky for you.
我得感谢你  麦克I have to thank you, Mike,
你遵守了约定For holding up your end of the deal.
我们交换吧Let's just make the trade.
把艾斯交给我们  他就归你了Give us Ace, and you can have him.
约定不是那样的Oh, that wasn't the deal.
真抱歉I'm so sorry.
能激活通讯器和跟踪器时告诉我Let me know when I can activate comms and the tracker.
怎么回事  麦克What's happening here, Mike?
我们让麦克把你交给我们换走他儿子Well, in exchange for his son, we asked Mike to deliver you.
我虽还没完全恢复I'm not at full strength,
但我还是能捏碎你的喉咙  新交易but I can still crush your throat. New deal!
我不杀你  还我儿子My son for your life.
不幸的是  我老板对我和你儿子的性命都不在乎Sadly, my employer cares no more for my life than your son's.
如果我死了  他也活不了If I die, so does he,
他的死会更为痛苦and his death will be so much worse.
你得放开她You need to let her go.
我跟他们说可以带走我I told them they could have me.
但他们想要你  为什么But they want you. Why do they want you?
我不知道  但如果你杀了这女人I don't know, but if you kill this woman,
你就再也见不到你儿子了you'll never see your son again.
可我要怎么面对他But how will I look him in the eye?
我要怎么解释我做了什么How will I explain what I did?
我们谈过的We talked about this.
真抱歉I'm so sorry.
进行交换吧Let's finish this.
爸爸Dad!
那是他儿子There's his son.
谢天谢地  我简直看不下去了Oh, thank god. I have no stomach for this.
听我命令  启动通讯器和跟踪器On my mark, activate comms and tracker.
如果还有别的选择If there had been any other way...
这是你唯一的选择You made the only choice you had.
出什么事了  他们带走了科尔森What happened? They've taken Coulson.
快上报  我们需要增援All right, call it in. We need backup.
我能一击毙命I have a shot.
别开枪  他们会杀了科尔森的Do not engage. They'll kill Coulson.
不要行动  我联系总部Stand down. I'll contact HQ.
你没事吧You okay?
我没事  爸爸I'm fine, dad.
神盾局总部  我是神盾局RG422S.H.I.E.L.D. HQ, this is S.H.I.E.L.D. RG422.
我们现在需要卫星支持We need immediate satellite support.
艾斯  我得去弥补过错Ace, I've got to make something right.
爸爸好爱你  好吗  和斯凯待在一起Daddy loves you so much, okay? Stay with Skye.
你还记得斯凯吧You remember Skye, right?
保护他  照顾好我儿子Keep him safe. Take care of my boy!
不No!!
麦克Mike!
科尔森呢Where's Coulson?
天啊Oh, my god.
科尔森Coulson.
我们半小时后着陆We land in half an hour.
好Good.
越早开始越好The sooner we begin, the better.
不管这是为了什么  不管你以为自己在干什么Whatever this is, whatever you think you're doing,
都不会成功的it won't work.
我不会让你如愿以偿的I won't give you what you want.
你会的You will.
我们想要的很简单And we want is simple.
我们要你说说  你死后那天的事We want you to tell us about the day after you died.
