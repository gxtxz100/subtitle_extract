有人偷了价值千万的钻石Somebody's stealing millions of dollars in diamonds.

我要你研究出他们怎么做到的I want you to figure out their exploit.
昨天  55名军人Yesterday, 55 men, all military,
受雇于全球最大的珠宝经纪商were hired by one of the largest gem brokers in the world.
他们穿着一样的衣服They dressed the men in identical outfits,
每人随机拿到了一个手提箱gave each one a randomly assigned briefcase,
分别走斯德哥尔摩市内25条不同的路线and sent them along 25 different routes here in Stockholm.
没人知道哪个手提箱中有钻石No one knew which briefcase contained the diamonds,
但还是被偷了but they were still stolen.
谢谢[瑞典语]Tack.
为什么搞这么复杂Why the Kabuki theater?
因为最近有人专偷钻石They were afraid because somebody's targeting diamonds --
米兰的装甲车被偷an armored car in Milan,
蒙特卡洛的保险箱被盗  现在又是这起a safe in Monte Carlo, and now this --
总值超过三千万Over $30 mil total.
每起都是在安保严密的情况下完成的Each theft occurred despite heavy security.
听起来像是内部人干的They sound like inside jobs.
很多人也这样想A lot of people share that opinion.
看来你不是You don't.
监控录像拍到行窃的录像了吗CCTV cameras catch any of the action?

我有个想法  但可能比较离奇I have a pitch, but it's way outside the box.
我就活在离奇世界里I live outside the box.
这世界上有人有超能力  对吗There are people in the world with superpowers, right?
如果这个女人有超感觉力呢What if this woman has ESP or something?
没有可靠的研究能证明预知能力There are no credible studies that support precognition,
心灵感应  或超感官知觉的存在telepathy, or extrasensory perception.
科学或许无法证明Okay, so science says no.
可这个女人知道无人知道的事But this woman knew impossible things.
而且为什么非要闭眼And why did she close her eyes?
要么是碰巧  要么就是非常重要That's either random or totally important.
她是在听Was she listening...
还是在读心or was she reading minds?
我去玩手机了I'm gonna go play with my phone now.
为什么总部叫我们调查这些抢劫案Why does H.Q. want us to investigate these heists?
不是总部  是我要接手的They don't. I picked this up.
-有什么发现吗  -有  手机信号满格- Any luck?  - Yep, I'm getting full bars,
所以如果我当时在这里which means if I was down here
有55个人带着恐怖的红面具and 55 guys were in scary red masks,
你知道我会怎么做吗you know what I would do?
玩图片分享Instagram.
了不起It's amazing.
这方面的工作真是越来越容易了Every year, this part of our job gets easier.
脸谱网  图片分享和网络相册Between FaceBbook, Instagram, and Flickr,
让每个人做起了自我监控people are surveilling themselves.
还有许多可选的滤器With many filters to choose from.
我在涨潮组织时  做这个就够厉害了I could do this pretty well when I was hacking for the Rising Tide,
但你们标记和搜索的能力简直超乎想象but you guys tag and search in ways the rest of us never dreamed of.
我可以用脸部识别软件处理这些照片I can run facial-recognition software on the photos,
和我们的犯罪数据库交叉对比cross-reference them with our criminal databases.
不用了You don't have to.
这就是那个小偷That's the thief.
她叫阿奇拉·阿玛多尔Her name's Akela Amador.
你确定吗You're certain?
当然  我培训过她I should be. I trained her.
阿奇拉·阿玛多尔曾是一名神盾局特工Akela Amador was a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent.
七年前  她带队突袭范查特的一个劳改营Seven years ago, she led a raid on one of Vanchat's gulags.
大家都以为Everyone believed that
她和另两名特工在任务中牺牲she and the two other agents on the mission were killed.
我怀疑过I had my doubts.
于是又派了队人去查看  以防万一So I sent in a second team, just in case.
他们发现了遗骸They found a lot of carnage
但无法确认是否是阿玛多尔的but couldn't confirm that any of it was Amador --
所以也没有定论Left the possibility open.
所以你听说了劫案的事That's why you chose this op --
就选择跟进这项调查when you heard about the heists.
这世上只有几个女人There are only a few women in the world
能完成如此不可能的事who could pull off something so impossible.
既然你在空客上  我想一定是她Since you're on the bus, I thought it had to be her.
瑞典海关确认阿玛多尔离开了瑞典Swedish customs confirmed that Amador left the country
其瑞典护照上用的是化名using an alias on a Swedish passport.
她飞往白俄罗斯She flew into Belarus,
买了张火车票去一个叫兹洛达的小镇bought a train ticket to a town called Zloda.
我同时列了一份I've also put together
有能力倒卖那么多钻石的人的名单a list of individuals who could fence that many diamonds.
目前还没有任何接触或行动There's been no contact or activity.
也许她是留着以备不时之需Maybe she's saving them for a rainy day,
用来买什么特别的东西buying something special.
集中精力找到阿玛多尔Let's focus on finding Amador.
我去通知总部  她还活着I'll let H.Q. know she's alive
好让他们协助追捕so they can assist with the manhunt.
我想推迟一下I'd like to hold off on that.
直到我们得到更多信息Until we know more.
联系白俄罗斯当局Contact Belarus authorities.
找个地方让我们停"空客"Find us a place to park the bus.
列一份兹洛达附近的旅馆  酒店Put together a list of inns, hotels,
以及养老院清单and pensions near Zloda.
数量应该不多There can't be that many of them.
我们会找到她的We'll find her.
看来我也不是那么特别嘛I'm not so special after all.
我不是你第一个徒弟I'm not your first protege.
别紧张  开个玩笑Relax. I'm teasing.
我知道我不算是徒弟I know I'm not a protege.
我都还不是真正的神盾局特工呢Hell, I'm not even a real, live S.H.I.E.L.D. agent yet.
你们俩完全不一样You two couldn't be more different.
阿玛多尔很聪明  很有本事  很勇敢Amador was smart, talented, fearless.
和我真是天渊之别啊Wow, there's nothing in common.
让我把话说完Let me finish.
她和其他人相处得不好She didn't play well with others,
觉得团队合作没意义found little value in teamwork.
我以为我可以给她灌输那些品质I thought I could instill those qualities in her,
所以我鞭策她...so I pushed her...
或许有点过火了maybe too hard.
别为这女人走上邪途而自责Don't blame yourself because this chick went to the dark side.
不管她走了怎样的路Whatever path she went down,
搅进了什么麻烦事  那是她的选择whatever weird stuff she got into, it's on her.
说好了是单独见面The agreement was to come alone.

你可以带着它过海关You can carry it through customs.
没人会发现的No one will know.
现在Now...
轮到你了It's your turn.
我开价三千万的时候When I said $30 million,
没想到有人能...I never thought anybody would --
如果这是假的If it fails,
你等着瞧吧I will find you.

但等你进去了But once you're inside,
你想好计划了吗do you have a plan?

梦想成真  真的吗A dream come true? Really?

出生地啊Zhores Alferov.
严格讲  他出生在维捷布斯克I mean, technically, he's from Vitebsk,
但离这里只有不到一小时的车程But that's less than an hour from here,
你居然不知道  我有点失望啊and I'm a bit disappointed that you didn't know that.
不  我当然知道他是谁Well, no, of course I know who that is,

长官  阿玛多尔攻击了我们Sir, Amador attacked you and your people.
她显然不像你那么念旧情Whatever regard you hold for her isn't reciprocated.
她打得我们满地找牙She just kicked us in the teeth.
大家还好吗How's the team?
受到了惊吓  但所幸没有受伤Rattled. No broken bones.
还好她意在逃跑  所以只是把货车撞翻了We're lucky she just knocked the van over so she could get away.
估计他们得好一阵才能缓过劲来Probably take awhile for our folks to refocus.
我想我可以恢复那个I think I can recover the data signature
加密广播的数字签名of that encrypted broadcast.
虽然我还没完全弄明白I don't understand it yet,
但她就是那样监视我们的but that's how she was watching us.

放到大屏幕上Uh, put it on the big monitor.

希望她坏的不止是镜头I hope she broke more than that.

现在录了We are now.
为什么我们能看到这个  镜头在哪里How are we seeing this? Where's the camera?

谁掌握这样的技术Who has tech like this?
我们没有  至少不像这样的We don't -- not like this.
没这么小巧  还能植入人体Not this small and internal.
这比我所见过的技术超前了十年That's at least a decade ahead of anything I've seen.
不过我看见样子了Though, now that I've seen it,
我或许能仿制一个  反向散射X光I could maybe approximate it -- the backscatter x-ray,
一个不会烧焦她大脑的微型接收器a micro-transceiver that somehow doesn't fry her brain,
一个内置电源an internal power source...
都要微型化  说真的  这...All miniaturized. Honestly, it's...
-真是太厉害了  -太厉害了- That's genius. - ...genius.
我们得带她回来We have to bring her in.
我们得除掉她  她是个武器We have to take her out. She's a weapon.
我会呼叫总部I'll call H.Q.,
看能不能叫一队特遣队支援我们See if we can bring a task force in to help us.
我们的队伍能应付得来Our team can handle this.
我明白I get it.
你觉得有责任  或许你逼她太紧了You feel responsible -- maybe you pushed her too hard.
但她差点杀掉我们三名队员But she tried to kill three members of our team.
如果她真想我们死  我们早就没命了If she wanted us dead, we'd be dead.
这次我们走运We got lucky.
你想再让我们冒一次险吗You want to risk our lives again?
你说你可以战斗了  你会支持我You told me you were ready for combat, that you had my back.
这点毋庸置疑Don't ever doubt it.
但你为了这个女孩  置队员于危险之中But you are defending this girl at the expense of the team.
因为我们要保护自己人Because we protect our own.
恕我直言  长官  她不是我们的一员With all due respect, sir, she's not one of our own.
你们看Guys.
为什么她还要请求许可Why does she have to ask for permission?
我可以睡觉吗
待命
她不是在被监视She's not being watched.
她是被控制了  我们得找到她She's being controlled. We have to find her.
我们轮流监视这个视频We'll take shifts watching the feed.
她迟早会看到什么Sooner or later, she'll look at something

我值首轮I'll take the first watch.
我只是来知会你一声I just wanted to give you a quick update.
她还在酒店里  所以...She's still at the hotel, so...
目前进展就这么多And that's the update.
真是混乱的一天  不是吗It's a pretty weird day, huh?
我们就像被困在一个货车型的糖罐里It's like we were trapped in a van-shaped pinata.
那件事确实不该发生That should never have happened.
没关系It's okay.
远不如看见爸爸妈妈在楼下吵架吓人It wasn't nearly as terrible as watching mom and dad fight downstairs.
那也不该发生That shouldn't have happened, either.
后悔加入我们了吗You regret coming along?
这的确很冲动  即便对我来说It was pretty impulsive, even for me.
我到现在也不太了解你I still don't know much about you...
就知道你非常看重老物件Except for you value really old stuff.
你也看重我And you value me.
很长时间没有人这么对我了First person to do that in a long time.
所以我认为你看人还是挺准的So I happen to believe you're an excellent judge of character.
如果你认为应当再给这个女人一次机会If you think this woman deserves a second chance,
那我们就该给她we should give it to her...
虽然她曾试图杀掉我...even though she tried to kill me
而且我也挺讨厌她的and I kind of hate her guts.
-菲兹  -怎么了- Fitz. - What?
-发生了什么  梅在哪  -我不知道- What happened? Where's May? - Uh, I don't know.
她之前在盯着传送过来的影像She was watching the transmission.

你什么都不知道You have no idea, do you?
我们知道你听命于人We know that you receive orders.
那你就该知道他们一看到你Then you know that once they see you,
能活着走出去的就只有一个人了only one of us gets to walk out of here.
他们安了自动防故障装置They built in a fail-safe.
我不杀你  他们就会杀我Either I kill you... or they kill me.

我用强力树眼镜蛇毒弹射中了你I hit you with a powerful dendrotoxin.
我眼睛里有一个致死开关There's a kill switch in my eye.
我的管理人怎么还没触发它呢Why hasn't my handler blown it yet?

你植入物的眼镜mimicking your implant.
现在  传送回去的是他的所见Right now, it's transmitting his point of view
而不是你的as if it was yours.
甚至还能呈现反向散射图像It even has backscatter imaging.
我能从管理人那里接到消息I get messages from my handler.
我们也能收到We're receiving those, as well.
我的特工正在去往托多洛夫大楼的路上My agent's on his way to the Todorov building --
替你完成任务  同时我们解除你眼睛里的Completing your mission while we disable the fail-safe
防故障装置in your eye.
我保证I promise.
他们看不到你They can't see you.
没事的  阿奇拉You're okay, Akela.
看着我Look at me.
他们监视你多久了How long have they been monitoring you?
很多年了Years.
你为什么要这么做  科尔森Why are you doing this, Coulson?
我要知道为什么一张感应卡能值三千万I need to know why a prox card is worth $30 million --
不是No.
你为什么这么做  为什么帮我Why are you doing this? Why are you helping me?
你不是应该教训我吗Where's the "I told you so"?
我现在不会那样了That's not me anymore.
你还活着我很高兴I'm just glad you're alive.
要是我做好自己的工作Vanchat would have never caught us

这是哪里Where are we?
托多洛夫大楼Todorov building.
好像是研究中心  不是军方的I think it's research, not military.
看起来像监狱Looks like a prison.
可以无线操作了吗We wireless yet?

我们找过你We looked for you.
有消息说你被带去了山西省Heard rumors you'd been taken to Shanxi Province.
后来终于有只小队来了When a team finally came,
我还以为是神盾局  但是I thought it was S.H.I.E.L.D. at first, but...
他们是谁Who were they?
我现在都不知道  但他们组织性很强Don't know, even to this day, but they were organized.
他们把我带去了一家诊所They took me to a clinic.

我的一举一动My every move.
他们给我发第一条消息时我才知道I had no idea until they sent the first message.
然后任务就开始了Then the assignments started.
大多数都是让我偷东西Mostly, it was "Steal this,"
跟踪人或者闯进什么地方"Follow him," "Break into there."
我开始不想理会他们I just tried to ignore them.
但那样就会有疼痛感But when I did, I'd get this pain,
像电刺激的偏头痛like an electric migraine.

他的用词The way he refers to certain things.
电梯他说"lift"而不是"elevator"He uses "lift" Instead of "elevator,"
汽车后备箱  他说"boot"不用"trunk""Boot" Instead of "trunk."

没办法  阿奇拉眼睛里有个致死开关We've got no other choice. There's a kill switch inside Akela.
可能是毒药  也可能是炸弹Could be a poison, could be an explosive.
无论是什么  一旦沃德被抓住Either way, if Ward's caught,
他们会立刻杀了她they'll kill her instantly.
长官  你要去哪Where are you going, Sir?

目标确认  准备行动
"目标"是什么意思What do they mean, "target"?
肯定没好事  特别是对那个目标来说It's never good, especially for the target.

你还是出来吧You should get out of there.
都走到这一步了I've come this far.
无论怎样我都要完成I'll finish, whatever it takes.
勾引他
帮帮我Help.
我没听错吧I'm sorry.
你是在求助吗Did you say, "Help"?
你刚刚不是说不要我帮忙吗Because a minute ago, you said you didn't want or need my help.
那是在他们要我色诱这家伙之前That was before they asked me to go all Mata Hari on this guy.
我直接把他打晕算了I'm just gonna knock him out.
沃德  等等  我们可能需要他通过下一道门Ward, wait. We may need them to get through the next door.

没事Oh, no problem.
沃德解释了一下操作手法Ward explained the sitch.
朝你来了Coming your way.
我不懂你什么意思I don't know what that means.
我们走Let's go.
