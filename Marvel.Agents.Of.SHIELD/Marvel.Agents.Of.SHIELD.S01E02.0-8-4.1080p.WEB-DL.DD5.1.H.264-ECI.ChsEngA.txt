19小时前
不许开出去兜风  听到没Hey, no joy rides, okay?
那可是我的家That's my house.
他们哪来的这些小玩意啊Where do they think of this stuff?
斯凯吗  她做不了神盾局特工Skye? Girl's not qualified to be a s.H.I.E.L.D. Agent.
同意Agreed.
所以我请她来做顾问That's why I've invited her on as a consultant.
这种事在神盾局屡见不鲜S.H.I.E.L.D. does it all the time.
其实斯塔克也算是顾问呢Technically, Stark's a consultant.
其实斯凯还是涨潮组织的成员呢And technically, Skye's a member of the Rising Tide.
她破解了我们的RSA加密系统She hacked our RSA implementation --
两次  还是用笔记本Twice. From a laptop.
如果有了我们的资源  想想她能做多少事Imagine what she'll do with our resources.
我想到了I am.
就因为我想到了  所以我不同意That's exactly what I'm imagining during this frown.
你找我来是评估风险You brought me on for risk assessment.
她就是个风险She's a risk.
她不会像我们那样思考问题She doesn't think like us.
没错Exactly.
科尔森特工都告诉我们了Oh, Agent Coulson told us the news.
真是太棒了What a wonderful surprise.

空客上已经有两个不能打斗的孩子了We have two kids on this bus who aren't cleared for combat.
你现在又找来一个You're adding a third.

斯凯算什么But Skye?
你还说这支队伍是精心挑选的You said this was a select team.
是为应对新的危机  保护人民而组建Assembled to work new cases, to protect people.
我实在不明白找个黑客跟来...I don't see how letting some hacker tag along --
你们的反应我都料到了I'm looking for an objection I haven't already anticipated.
这事我已经决定了I'm calling this.
但是你的异议会留有记录But your frown will be on record.
我们接到命令前去调查一个084We've been called in to investigate an 0-8-4.
我们都知道那是什么意思We all know what that means.
是的Yes, we do.
就是我们不知道那是什么东西的意思It means we don't know what that means.
官方说法叫做空中移动指挥站Officially, it's an airborne mobile command station.
但我们管它叫"空客"[空中客车]But we call it the bus.
出外勤的时候起名字都是越短越好We find it best to use shorthand when in the field.
干什么都是这样的But everything has to be just so, you know,
因为任务的危险性because of the danger.
是啊  我之前来过这儿的Yeah, I've been up here before,
可惜没看到什么but I didn't see much
因为沃德特工给我头上套了个袋子because of the bag that Agent Ward put over my head.
是啊  那事真是抱歉Yes, so sorry about that.
喝水吗Water?
两分钟后起飞  坐稳  别抽风Wheels up in two. Lock it or lose it.

刺穿了我的心脏with a Chitauri scepter.
不过效果相似The effect was similar.
休了几周假  还混到架飞机Got a few weeks' R&R and this plane.
做了彻底翻修Had it completely refurbished.
进行了加固  一点没浪费经费Studs up -- spared no expense.

系好安全带Buckle up.
我都不知道我们要去哪I don't even know where we're going.
秘鲁  084是在那里发现的Peru. That's where the 0-8-4 was reported.
084代表...And an 0-8-4 is...?
来源不明的物体An object of unknown origin.
跟你挺像的Kind of like you.
我们过去  确定物体是否有用Team goes in, determines if it's useful
或者是否构成威胁or if it poses a threat.

这里太暴露了Too much exposure here.
我去找个僻静的地方停车I'm gonna find a place to park.
我真太想看到野生的僧帽猴了I would love to see a capuchin in the wild.
或许还能看到黄尾绒毛猴Maybe even a yellow-tailed woolly monkey.
要知道秘鲁有32种猴子呢You know, um, Peru has 32 different species of monkey.
是啊  还有近两百种蛇Yeah, and close to 200 species of snakes.
南美巨蝮的毒液十分厉害The shushupe has a fascinating ven-- venom.

真是够厉害的That's fascinating.
是啊Yeah.
别怕啊  其实地震啊什么的更可怕No, I'd be much more concerned with earthquakes, mala--
登革热是没有疫苗的哦There's no vaccine for dengue fever.
快瞧瞧啊Oh, look at this.
如果这个084有危险我们应该We should warn the people who live around here
警告附近的居民if the 0-8-4 is dangerous.
他们已经需要应付反对挖矿的反抗军They're already dealing with anti-mining rebels
和秘鲁游击队的野蛮人了and the Shining Path guerillas.
我可以发点什么I could post something.
还记得那次反物质流星在迈阿密海岸边陨落Remember the panic when that anti-matter meteor
差点毁了整座城市时splashed down just off the coast of Miami,
-引起的恐慌吗  -不记得啊- nearly devoured the city? - No.
没错  因为我们封锁了消息控制了局面Precisely. Because we kept it quiet and contained.
那我来干什么So, what am I doing?
如果消息泄露出去Well, if it gets out,
我可能需要你转移大众的视线I might need you to create some kind of diversion,
让大家关注别的去put the public on the wrong scent.
就是说做我最反对做的事So everything that I'm against.
没错Yep.
早啊教授Good morning, professor.
我是神盾局的科尔森特工I'm Agent Coulson with S.H.I.E.L.D.
听说你发现了一样有趣的东西I understand you've made an interesting discovery.
我都不知道该如何解释I-I'm not sure how to explain it.
这座神庙至少有五百年历史了This temple dates back at least 500 years.
里面全是印加时代以前的文物It's filled with pre-Incan artifacts.
而其中一样东西根本不该出现One of them is impossible
而且看样子可能有危险and looks like it might be dangerous.
我们就是为这个来的Well, that's why we're here.
小心Watch out.
原封未动Exactly as we found it.
还有谁知道Who else knows about this?
只有当地政府Just the ministry.
是他们联系了你们吧I believe they are the ones who contacted you.
先生  请你和你的团队撤离现场Sir, I need you and your team to evacuate the site
直到我们确定此物件的危险性until we determine the risk associated with this object.
别去动他Leave the man alone.
瞌睡虫
出于你自身的安全考虑Now -- for your own safety.
完全没有人在谈论这东西Nothing about this anywhere.
真不可思议It's amazing.
我搜索了每一个数据流I searched every data stream.
什么情况啊What do you got here, guys?
小心啊  你还是...别碰了Whoa, car-- uh, careful. I-I -- no, wouldn't do that.
不明物体嵌在化石岩层中The object's placement in fossiliferous rock formations
所以它应该至少在那儿待了一千五百年了suggests it's been here for at least 1,500 years.
那可比神庙的历史长一千年呢That pre-dates this temple by a millennium.
或许是外星来的Ah! Maybe it's alien.
或许吧  但是从外形和制造工艺来看Yeah, but the shape and the craftsmanship --
很像是德国制造的it's almost German.
轮胎印跟教授的一样Tires match the prof's truck.
你的配枪呢Where's your sidearm?
我要是需要用枪就会去夺一把来If I need a gun, I'll take one.

不许再那么说Don't ever call me that.
抱歉Apologies.
我听说过你的事迹I've heard the stories --
巴林岛的事  那次行动的事what went down in in Bahrain, about you in action.
科尔森让你回归真是明智之举You know, it was smart of Coulson to pull you out of retirement.

你该多带两把枪的Should have taken more guns.

我们一起共事过We used to work together back in the day.
告诉大家一切都好Let the team know everything's okay.
我知道你们在秘鲁领土上找到了奇怪的物件I know you've found a strange object on Peruvian soil.
我们应该谈谈怎么处理这件事We should have a conversation about how to proceed.

但它们跟任何已知同位素都不匹配but they don't match any known isotope.
我这里得到暂时性匹配  但数值一直在变I get temporal matches, but even then, they seem to shift.
那可能吗Is that even possible?
那得取决于暂时性无线电之类的变化[不懂装懂中]Depends on the shifting of the temporal radio stuff,
很奇怪  不是吗It's totally weird, right?
我去找科尔森I'm gonna go check on Coulson.

不用担心  设备现在很稳定Not to worry. The device is stable.
虽然还是随时可能爆炸Not that it couldn't explode at any minute,
尤其是如果被机枪扫射什么的especially if hit with machine-gun fire.
但是这种事也是时有发生But things like this happen from time to time
出外勤就这样  起初挺辛苦的when in the field, and at first, it's very unpleasant,
会让你后悔离开了实验室and you regret your decision to leave the lab at all.
你神经病吗Are you mental?

这里有什么问题吗Do we have a problem in here?
没有  长官No, sir.
我们只是在交流而已Just working on our communication.
并不是所有人都有交火的准备Not everyone was prepared for a firefight.
我们成功出来了  没有人员伤亡We got out, didn't lose anyone,
还救了几个他们的人saved a few of theirs --
这不是做得挺好吗I'd say we did all right.
还有问题吗Anything else?
我有个小问题Uh, yeah. I have a small question.
我一直以为自己是跟在大家后面的菜鸟土包子Because I've been feeling like the tagalong hayseed rookie,

我当队长也可以呢I might as well be team captain.
开个玩笑  但或许这个主意也不赖I was joking, but maybe that's not a bad idea,
反正这些人不是很喜欢彼此because these guys do not like each other much.
不是为这个This isn't about that.
我是行动专家I'm a specialist.
今天我如果是单独行动Today, I could have eliminated the enemy threat myself
完全可以消除敌人的威胁if I was working alone,
但我还得顾及毫无战斗经验的特工but I had non-combat-ready agents --
等下  自己单干Whoa, whoa. Wait. You work alone?
典型做派  你以为你的装备是谁设计的So typical. Who do you think designs your equipment?
-还有你武器用的高分子材料  -就是嘛- Or the polymers for your weaponry. - Yeah.
-都是我们这种人做的  -你敢光着屁股- People like us do it. - Try going into the field
去出外勤吗with just your bare bum.
看到我刚说的了吧See them proving the point I just made?
你说得没错You're not wrong.
我们仍需要磨合We still need to iron out the kinks.

西蒙斯  你有两个我都念不出名字的博士学位Simmons, you have two PhDs in fields I can't prounounce,
菲兹  你是个火箭专家and, Fitz, you are a rocket scientist.
所以你们自己搞定So work it out.
我也有自己擅长的哈I-I'm -- I'm good at stuff, too.
那我们是工作  还是继续...So, should we work or just continue to --
我就是说  我们早晚会对I'm saying I said there would come a moment
出外勤感到后悔when we would regret the decision to go in the field.
只是没想到第一周就后悔了I didn't think that would happen in week one.
老天Oh, god.

我不太想提起这个And I don't want to bring it up
因为我不想看见你一副厌恶的表情because I don't want to see your hate face,
但是  涨潮组织就是做这个的but...that's what the Rising Tide is all about.

完全同意There we agree.
我们周围的环境飞速变化With everything around us changing so quickly,
保留一些过去的试金石有益无害it doesn't hurt to have a few touchstones to the past.
能提醒我什么是重要的Reminds me what's important.
我最不愿做的  就是重温过去The last thing I want to do is relive days gone by.
几个夜晚或许还值得回忆A few nights, maybe.
我知道你在做什么I see what you're doing.
我在追忆往昔I'm reminiscing.
这架飞机比当年你驻扎在库斯科时This plane is such a step up
我们外勤用的旅行车from the R.V. we used to work out of
档次提升了不少when you were stationed in Cusco.
我对工作的印象不深I don't remember much working.
也不记得你会这么直接I also don't remember you being this direct.
斯凯  把酒瓶递给我Skye, hand me the bottle.
好吧  酒鬼Okay, turbo,
你手里的那杯还没喝完呢but you're still nursing the one you got.
不止我一人没喝啊I'm not the only one.
接下来的几小时我们要困在云层上方了We're stuck above the clouds for the next few hours.
何不找点乐子We might as well enjoy ourselves.
我们可以为你的收藏多创造点回忆We could make a few more memories to add to your collection.
怎么样What do you think?
我觉得...I think...
沃德已经发现Ward already knows
你想成功夺下飞机就得先除掉梅you'll have to eliminate May from the equation to have a chance...
这给了他大约20秒时间先发制人which gives him about 20 seconds to get to her first.
我们本是盟友We were allies.
我们有段过往We had history.
你什么时候决定抛弃这一切的When did you decide to throw that away?
看到你的队伍的时候As soon as I saw your team.
我现在还没死的原因是The reason I'm still alive is because
总部随时可能呼入  而你需要我you need me to verify the change of routes for your pilot
替你的飞行员核实航线变更when H.Q. Calls in any minute now.
-感激不尽  -如果我不那么做- I'd appreciate that. - But if I don't,
神盾局就会把这架飞机在空中击毁S.H.I.E.L.D. Will shoot this aircraft out of the sky.
那样你也会失去084That'll take the 0-8-4 out of your hands.
也许我该让他们这么做Maybe I should let them.
不会的  我觉得你会照做的Oh, no, I think you'll make the calls.
你为了一个实验室人员You already handed me your plane
就把这架飞机拱手相让了for the life of one of your little lab rats.
如果我把货舱打开  你会失去他们所有人If I open the cargo hold, you'll lose them all.
而你又是那么多愁善感And you are such a sentimentalist.
这都是我的错This is my fault.
我应该去学点功夫来着Should have learned Kung Fu.
好吧  不过我当初Oh, yeah, but I shouldn't have
就不该逼你出外勤pushed you into the field in the first place.
你还没做好准备You weren't ready.
作出恰当的威胁评估是我的工作It was my job to make a proper threat assessment.
-是我们  我们都没准备好  -如果特工梅- We -- we weren't ready.  -This wouldn't have happened
当时没在开飞机  就不会如此了if Agent May wasn't on the stick.
她就能使出她的忍者技能了She would have busted out some of her ninja know-how.
特工梅  不不Agent May? No. No, no.
她是从管理部门调过来的She transferred from administration.
我亲眼见过她放倒一个人  所以...Well, I've seen her destroy a guy, so...
你们听过铁骑吗You've heard of The Cavalry?
-有啊  -听过啊- Yeah. - Yeah.
学院里的每个人都在谈论...Wh-- everyone at the academy talks about st--
她就是铁骑吗She's the Cavalry?
我说过永远别那么叫我I told you never to call me that.
简直难以置信I can't believe it.
这下我们肯定能出去了Oh, we're sure to get out of here now.
我们要怎么从这里出去Um, how do we get out of here?
不能走门Can't go through the doors.
门锁死了  跟增压系统相连They're bolted, tied to the pressurization lines.
你们两个天才没办法了吗You two geniuses have nothing?
这种紧张环境下很难集中精神嘛Yeah, well, it's hard to concentrate in these intense situations.
别慌Hey. Don't freeze up.
深呼吸一下Take a breath.
你们不用全盘考虑You don't need to come up with the whole solution.
只解决一部分就行  好吗Just part of it. Right?
是啊Yeah.
众人拾柴火焰高Pieces solving a puzzle.
你早就知道这物件是件武器You knew this was a weapon all along.
但是让你先得到了But you got to it first.
所以我不得不扮好人I had to play nice.
没错  科尔森  至少这次我是先你一步Yes, Coulson. For once, I'm actually ahead of you.
我们国家十几年前就订制了那件武器My country commissioned that weapon decades ago.
九头蛇组织解体后After the fall of Hydra,
很多科学家跟随他们的纳粹朋友many scientists followed their Nazi friends
躲到了世界的这一边to hide on this side of the world.
德国制造German engineering.
武器在一次丛林冲突中遗失了The weapon was lost during a clash in the jungle
直到今天until today.
有了它  我们就能结束反抗军的起义With it, we'll end the Rebel uprising
让我的祖国稳定下来and finally stabilize my country.
你是说统治你的国家You mean rule your country.
你留在你们国家  我留在我的国家You stay in your borders. I'll stay in mine.
国界正在消失Those borders are disappearing.
外星人袭击了纽约  记得吗Aliens descended on New York, remember?
他们不会在意你的肤色They don't care whose colors you wear.
只在乎谁挡了道They just care who's in the way.
我们应该并肩作战We should be working together,
而不是内斗not fighting.
这是目前最糟的主意了Well, that's clearly the worst idea we've heard yet.
但感觉能行But it could work.
雷耶斯一降落就会杀掉我们Reyes is gonna kill us the minute we land, regardless,
然后推到反抗军头上and blame it on rebels.
但至少这样  我们有反击的机会This way, we have a fighting chance.
我不会浪费I'll take it.
首先要解决什么What's first?
不穿过实验室就到不了楼上We can't get upstairs without going in the lab.
但实验室的门只能从楼上打开And the only way to release the lab doors is from upstairs.
首先要解决的是  我们被绑在货舱门上了The first thing is, we're tied to the cargo door,
除非你能...So unless you can --
那是什么声音What the hell was that?
她的手腕Her wrist.
下一步干什么What's next?
那是11年前吧Was it 11 years ago, now?
你跟着神盾局从天而降You swooped in with S.H.I.E.L.D.
那么自信  那么神秘with so much confidence, so much mystery.
你那时有一百名部下You had 100 men at your disposal.
-但现在  -亲自甄选的团队- And now--  - A hand-picked team.
没错  他们很优秀And, yes, they're that good.
菲尔  你都没意识到Oh, phil. You're not even aware.
你的新理想主义  你的收藏品Your renewed idealism, your collectibles,
你的空中私人空间Your airborne man cave,
周围是一群年轻有魅力的特工surrounding yourself with young, attractive agents --
你是遇上中年危机了吧You're having a mid-life crisis.
其实应该说是"来世"感悟More an afterlife thing, really.
更不用提那辆红色科尔维特And I'm not going to even mention the red corvette.
她叫洛拉Her name's Lola.
毫无疑问Of course it is.
简直太典型了It's textbook.
你建立这支团队  不过想觉得自己有分量You built this team so you could feel relevant,
被人需要to feel needed.
他们需要的不是我They don't need me.
是时间They need time.
但他们没时间了Well, time is not on their side.
但你给了他们更好的No, but you gave them something better --
共同的敌人a common enemy.
我们都确定了吧  大家都同意吗Okay, we're sure, right? Everyone's sure?
-我们都同意  -我们快点搞定吧- We're all on board.  - Yeah, let's do this fast.
不能后悔  不能慌张No turning back. No freezing up.
因为那样会...Because if we do, then...
-害死所有人  -我们明白- All of us die. - We know.
好了All right.
你们废话真多You guys talk a lot.
别  这正是他们的目的
神盾616号  雷达可以看到你S.H.I.E.L.D. 6-1-6, we have radar contact.
请求确认航线变更  完毕Requesting confirmation on a change in course. Over.
快回答  不然他们都会尝到Answer it, or they all learn
从三万英尺高空下落的滋味what a 30,000-foot drop feels like.
科尔森特工  你在吗Agent Coulson, are you there?
请确认航线You have course confirmation.
可以航向"弹弓"发射基地You are cleared direct to the Slingshot.
科尔森特工Agent Coulson?
情况一切正常吗Everything all right up there?
听说你们在地面上遇到了点麻烦We heard you had a little dustup on the ground.
我们没问题Yeah, we're all good.
从现在起  天空会一片晴朗It's gonna be blue skies from here on out.
西蒙斯  忘掉我说过的话Simmons, forget what I said before.
这才是我们会后悔的一刻This is the moment that we'll regret.
成功了It worked.
突变气压让门都打开了The drop in cabin pressure released the doors.
我去搞定士兵I'll take care of the soldiers.
你们去拿084You guys get to the 0-8-4.
科尔森呢And Coulson?
祈求他能自保吧Let's hope he can handle himself.
退后Get back!
快去  找084Go now! Find the 0-8-4!
帮帮我Help me! Help!
科尔森Coulson!
坚持住Hold on!
没事了It's okay.
菲兹Fitz!
拿到了  拉我们回去We've got it! Reel us back in!
我在拉你了I've got you!
你在干嘛  我们需要你的帮忙What are you doing? We need your help!
相信我Trust me!
只是不想让你尝到从三万英尺高空下落的滋味Don't want you to know what a 30,000-foot drop feels like.
割断绳子Cut him loose!
-抱歉  -抱歉了  沃德- Sorry!  - Sorry, Ward!
抓紧了Hold on!
我读了安全手册I read the safety pamphlet.
你大概是第一个读的人I think you might be the first.
没其他办法了吗No other way in, huh?
我们才刚开始适应这地方Was just starting to warm up to this place.
084正在冷却稳定下来The 0-8-4 is cooling and stable.
但我们应该联系总部But we should call H.Q. and
尽快把它送去"弹弓"发射基地get it to the Slingshot as soon as possible.
跟你说了他们很优秀Told you they were good.
"弹弓"发射基地  地点:保密
你车毫发无伤  但飞机毁了Not a scratch. But your plane's totaled.
希望神盾局的保险还包括劫机I hope S.H.I.E.L.D. insurance covers hijackings.
当然了  在杂费那一栏Sure. Under "Incidentals."
我到底把自己卖到什么地方来了What exactly am I signing up for?
我说过Like I said --
前排观赏地球上最奇怪的演出Front-row seat to the craziest show on earth.
是啊  但我没有想到这么快表演就这么疯狂了Yeah, but I didn't expect the show to get this crazy this fast
而且还是为了个要销毁的东西all for an object you're just gonna destroy.
"弹弓"是标准程序Slingshot is protocol.
084这种武器太危险了A weapon like the 0-8-4 is too dangerous
不能被任何人或者国家拿到for any person or country to have.
雷耶斯这种人会穷追不舍People like Reyes would always be after it.
对了  雷耶斯是怎么回事What happened with Reyes, anyway?
她被关在神盾局的一个拘留设施内She's being held at a S.H.I.E.L.D. detainment facility.
我估计秘鲁政府会通过谈判让她获释I expect the Peruvian government will negotiate for her release.
她不会在监狱里待太久的She probably won't spend much time in jail.
不  我是问你跟雷耶斯之间发生过什么No, I mean what happened with you and Reyes?
你俩当年绝对有过一腿吧You guys totally did it back in the day, right?
那是机密That's classified.
看来斯凯今后不会仅仅是个顾问啊Looks like Skye might end up as more than just a consultant,
尽管我们对此有顾虑despite our reservations.
她或许能成为骨干She could turn into a solid asset...
只是需要好好调教with some serious work.
她要是想成为外勤特工Well, if she wants to be a field agent,
那就需要一个监管人员she'll need a supervising officer --
纪律严明  厉害的人someone disciplined, someone good.
好吧All right.
我来做I'll do it.
先说清楚  你说的是我吧Just to clarify, you were, uh, talking about me, right?
我们炸了架飞机We blew up a plane.
我获得了新经验I had a new experience.
吃瘪吧  沃恩教授Eat that, Professor Vaughn.
你也获得了新经验You had a new experience.
但对我们所有人来说都是新体验But it was new for all of us.
他们挺快活They're happy.
快来  你们肯定不想错过这个Hey, come on. You guys don't want to miss this.
它大概需要180天到达太阳So, it'll take about 180 days to reach the sun.
当然如果用氢燃料辅助动力装置的话Now, yes, of course, it would have been faster
会快得多  但是这也挺不错if they'd used hydrogen-fueled APUs, but they're having fun.
你们有多少那玩意儿How many of those have you guys had?
斯..Sk--
斯凯Skye.
出外勤一定得时不时放松一下It's important when in the field to unwind from time to time.
没错  尤其是经历了死里逃生的一天之后Yeah, yeah, especially after a hard day of everyone almost dying.
还好不是天天都这样  对吧Which doesn't happen every day, right?
这是不正常的  不寻常的It's an anomaly -- an irregularity.
非...常态Not...the norm.
说到"非常态"Speaking of "Not the norm,"
在飞机上炸个洞是谁的主意Whose idea was it to blow a hole in the plane?
梅说门跟增压系统相连  我就想May said that the doors were tied to the pressurization, so I thought --
我们就想那是开门的唯一办法So we thought it was the only way to release them.
这是大家的主意  长官It was everyone's idea, Sir.
是啊  其实挺聪明的Yes, quite genius, really.
干得漂亮Nice work.
准备发射All clear for liftoff.
要发射了Oh, time for blastoff.
准备发射Launching...
三In three...
二...two...
轨道会带它越过拉格朗日点The trajectory will take it beyond the Lagrange point
所以不会撞上天王星so that it doesn't hit Herschel.
而且最近没有日冕物质抛射And there haven't been any coronal mass ejections,
所以遥测应该不会失灵so it shouldn't lose telemetry.
伙计们  你们能说英语吗Guys, English.
涨潮组织进入停滞状态  准备转入地下运作  你情况如何  回复
我已就位
不是吧Really?
你开我心吗  科尔森Really, Coulson?
六天Six days?
你只花了六天时间It only took you six days
就把一架彻底翻新的最先进的飞机to take a completely renovated piece of state-of-the-art machinery
变成了一堆垃圾and turn it into scrap?!
我的队员是在我授权下行动的My team acted with my authority.
别跟我说什么授权Don't talk to me about authority.
你知不知道这架飞机值多少钱Do you know how much this plane cost?
还有个吧台呢It's got a bar.
很不错的吧台A really nice one.
说什么授权Talking to me about authority.
你知道吗  我有权把你扁到负级You know, I have the authority to downgrade your ass to a winnebago.
我知道  长官I'm aware of that, Sir.
给我修好  恢复如初Well, I want it fixed just like you found it.
别让菲兹-西蒙斯搞什么改造So don't have Fitz-Simmons going making modifications,
弄个破鱼缸什么的like a-a-a-a... damn fish tank.
是  长官Yes, Sir.
还有新来的姑娘And the new girl --
她是风险因素She's a risk.
我知道  长官I know, Sir.
你知道  长官You know, Sir?
洛拉怎么样How's Lola?
她很好  长官She's fine, Sir.
谢谢关心Thanks for asking.
还跟我说什么授权Talking to me about authority.
鱼缸的事没戏了Yeah, we're gonna have to kill the fish tank.
