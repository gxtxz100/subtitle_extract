漫威《神盾局特工》前情回顾Previously on "Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."...
跟我们说说赛博科技和死亡战士计划Tell us about cybertek and the deathlok program.
麦克·彼得森还活着Mike Peterson's alive.
他们对他做了什么They did something to him.
GH325  科尔森特工被注射了这种物质Gh-325 -- Agent Coulson was injected with that,
几分钟之后and literally minutes later,
他的伤口就开始出现细胞再生his wounds showed signs of cellular regeneration.
弗瑞用尽手段保守这个秘密Fury went to dangerous lengths to keep this under wraps.
我们不能告诉任何人We can't share this with anyone,
为了他们的安全  也为我们自己for their safety and ours.
加密线路安全Encrypted line secure.
梅琳达·梅特工  更新日志93Agent Melinda May. Update log 93.
科尔森知道了Coulson knows.
澳大利亚  悉尼
约翰·加勒特特工  身份确认Agent John Garrett, confirmed.
安托万·崔普利特特工  身份确认Agent Antoine Triplett, confirmed.
虽比不上四季酒店Well, it's no Four Seasons.
对安全屋来说  这里算不错了Well, as safe houses go, it's not bad.
普吉岛的连床垫都没有Phuket didn't even have mattresses.
但开罗的有高级床单Yeah, but Cairo had thousand-thread-count sheets,
还用棉缎处理过with that sateen finish.
别习惯那种优越待遇Hey, be careful what you get used to.
把卫星电话拿出来  打给科尔森Dig out that sat phone and get Coulson on the line.
我要跟他核对一下潜在目标I want to run down through the list of potential candidates with him.
你真认为千里眼在名录上吗You really think the Clairvoyant was on the Index?
是没被收入名录  有这可能Rejected off the index. Possibly.
希望不是克雷斯金[心灵感应大师]Just hope it's not the amazing Kreskin.
我以前可喜欢他了I used to love that guy.
-谁  -三区有人入侵- Who? - Area 3, breach.
用冰冻枪Hit him with an icer!
搞什么What the hell?
科尔森特工  你知道You realize, Agent Coulson,
现在有电话会议这种东西吧they have these things called teleconferences now.
见到你很高兴  汉德特工Nice to see you, too, Agent Hand.
感谢你们一接到通知就赶来Thank you all for coming on such short notice.
这样见面不太合常规啊A little unconventional meeting this way, isn't it?
从我拿到的报告看  不合常规Oh, from the reports I've read, "unconventional" seems to be
如今是科尔森的专长了Coulson's middle name these days.
如果打起来  我选布莱克Fight breaks out, let me take Blake.
他腼腆但好斗He's coy but scrappy.
等我们到达五万英尺  我就解释一切I'll explain everything as soon as we hit 50,000 feet.
这边请This way.
已到达巡航高度Cruising altitude reached,
北极上空90度bearing 90 degrees just over the north pole.
-谢谢  -抱歉搞得这么复杂- Thank you. - Apologies for the song and dance,
但这么做是为了防患未然but we brought you here as a precaution.
防什么患A precaution against what?
千里眼The Clairvoyant.
如果真有人会读心术If there is someone out there who can read minds,
至少在这里  我们能尽可能离他远点At least up here, we're as far away from him as possible.
说不定北极光Thinking maybe the northern lights
能对他的读心无线信号有所干扰will knock a few bars off his psychic wi-fi.
科尔森  你知道神盾局对读心术的看法Coulson, you know S.H.I.E.L.D.'s stance on psychics
它们不存在They don't exist.
你突然相信了吗Are you suddenly a believer?
也不是Not definitively.
但我最近遇到了一个阿斯加德人But I had a recent experience with an Asgardian
她可以用自己的声音控制他人的意愿who could bend people's will with her voice.
可以说让我不得不考虑了Forced me to open my mind, so to speak.
我们只知道千里眼总能先我们一步All we know for sure is the Clairvoyant's been a step ahead of us,
盗用我们的战略手段stealing plays from our playbook.
这让我很不爽And it's pissing me off.
相信你们都看过加勒特特工最新的报告了I take it you've all read Agent Garrett's latest report.
安全屋遭袭The hit on the safe house.
彼得森先生还活蹦乱跳Mr. Peterson's alive and kicking.
我们称他为死亡战士We call him Deathlok.
这是该项目的代号It was the project's code name.
加勒特特工和我这几周一直在追查他Agent Garrett and I have been tracking him the last few weeks.
我们认为千里眼的超级保镖And we think the Clairvoyant's super-soldier bodyguard
找上我们是有原因的came after us for a reason.
我们接近他了We're getting close.
接近什么  他的身份吗To what? His identity?
我们把潜在目标范围缩小到13个We've narrowed the list to 13 candidates.
如何缩小的  从哪找到的潜在目标Narrowed it how? From what?
加勒特特工最近重新查看了Agent Garrett has been taking a second look
神盾局的特殊能力者名录at S.H.I.E.L.D.'s gifted index,
尤其是那些未被收录的specifically the rejects.
那些神盾局曾约谈过Individuals S.H.I.E.L.D. interviewed
被认为可能有心灵感应能力who are believed to have psychic abilities
但最终未被收录的人but were ultimately dismissed.
那么你认为我们以前接触过千里眼So you think we've encountered the Clairvoyant before.
想想我们在全世界接触过多少案件Think how many cases we've encountered across the globe,
审查过多少人how many cases we vetted.
不仅是有可能  而是很有可能It's more than possible. It's probable.
我需要再来点咖啡了I need more coffee.
假设你说的情况是可能的Let's assume what you're saying is possible.
然后呢What then?
如果我们面对的真是个有千里眼能力的人If we're going up against an actual clairvoyant,
我们要怎么与之抗衡呢how do you suggest we combat that?
将信息碎片化By compartmentalizing the information.
我团队中有一个A member of my team is an expert
模式识别分析专家at pattern recognition and analysis --
能够抽丝剥茧处理数据finding needles in haystacks.
她会将加勒特名单上的人进行优先排序She'll prioritize the candidates on Garrett's list,
找到他们locate them,
再把我们随机分成两人小组then pair us off into random teams.
这样只有一个人知道That way, only one person knows
任务的全部信息the full scope of the mission.
你知道你所说的这个人You do understand that this person you're referring to --
她至少得是个神盾局特工She'd need to be a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent
才能有这个权限吧to be granted that level of access.
很高兴你提到了这点I'm glad you brought that up.
伙计们  我发誓  我很好Guys, I swear, I am fine.
你们到底还要抽多少血才能相信我How much blood are you gonna draw before you believe me?
你的康复  实在是不可思议Your recovery -- it's honestly quite unbelievable.
很奇怪Strange.
我们知道科尔森的恢复与你不太一样We know Coulson had a very different recovery experience,
所以我们理解so we understand
他为什么不太想告诉别人这一发现why he's hesitant about sharing our findings with others.
是啊  但这样的药物该有人研究Yeah, but something like this drug -- it needs to be studied.
它或许能拯救许多人的生命Has the potential to save so many lives.
我们想把你的血液样本We'd like to send a blood sample of yours
交给一些同事去做分子分解to some colleagues to do a molecular breakdown.
也许如果你和科尔森特工谈谈Maybe if you spoke to Agent Coulson --
我觉得这样不太好Yeah, I don't think that's a good idea.
如果科尔森认为这事必须保密If Coulson thinks it's important that this stays between us,
那我们就应该相信他then we should trust him.
是吧  毕竟他是头头Right? He's the boss.
那么你是说我们该遵守规定吗So you're saying we should obey the rules.
你是谁  你对斯凯做了什么Who are you, and what have you done with Skye?
斯凯  到楼上来Skye, upstairs.
大领导要见你Top brass wants to see you.
配对组合是个好想法Pairing off makes total sense.
我还有个想法  不如采取双盲法则Just one thought, though -- what if we make it a double-blind?
怎么说How so?
我把潜在目标的位置Well, I'll give one person from each team
告诉每个小队中的一个人the potential Clairvoyant's coordinates,
把身份信息告诉另一个人and I'll give the other one the identity.
那样的话  到达目的地前That way, no one person knows
每个人都不知道任务的全部信息the full specs of the op until you get there.
我喜欢你的思考方式  我喜欢她的思考方式I like how you think. I like how she thinks.
只有一个问题  我要如何在One question -- how am I supposed to access
无人监视的情况下查阅那些机密信息呢all the classified files without someone in the room?
我没有权限I don't have clearance.
现在你有了Now you do.
欢迎加入神盾局  斯凯Welcome to S.H.I.E.L.D., Skye.
国土战略防御攻击与后勤保障局
我叫他们上来的I told them to come up.
我不知道该说什么了I -- I... I don't know what to say.
谢谢你Thank you.
不用谢我Don't thank me.
你出色地通过了所有神盾局要求的测试You've passed every required S.H.I.E.L.D. exam with flying colors.
只是一级特工的测试For a level 1 agent.
你多次在外勤任务中协助过我们You've assisted us on multiple field missions,
不惜将自己置于危险之中put your life on the line.
这是你应得的You earned this.
你腹部中了两枪呢Hell, you took two in the gut.
比西特韦尔这辈子都强More than Sitwell here's ever done.
好了  大家都回去工作吧Okay, everyone. Back to work.
祝贺你Congratulations.
-祝贺你  斯凯  -太棒了- Congratulations, skye. - Awesome!
恭喜Congratulations.
多亏了我那位厉害又有耐心的监管人员啊Couldn't have done it without a great and very patient S.O.
不  是靠你自己Yeah, you could have.
我不是千里眼I'm no clairvoyant,
但我相信有些事是注定的but I do believe some things are meant to be.
别说我什么都没给过你
武器系统载入中
武器系统载入中
武器准备完毕
他们要来找我了
我们该见面了
对这个双盲法则我可不敢苟同Can't say I'm a fan of this double-blind situation.
这样外勤小队要怎么和我们在目的地会合How will the field teams meet us at the destinations?
他们不会来  而是在别处待命They won't. They'll be on standby.
不能冒让千里眼知道我们要去的险We can't risk the Clairvoyant knowing we're coming.
这样一来  有一队人What you're saying is, one of these teams
可能会遭遇伏击  而没有任何后援could be heading straight into an ambush without backup.
西特韦尔特工  我刚接到三曲翼总部来的消息Agent Sitwell, I just received word from the Triskelion.
命令你立即去雷姆利亚星号报到You have orders to report to the Lemurian Star immediately.
与《美国队长2》开篇呼应
你会接替他的工作吧So I assume you'll take his place.
跟你去追踪圣诞老人吗  不In your hunt for Santa Claus? No.
我要搭乘喷气运输机回中心I'm taking a transport jet back to the Hub
在那儿通过卫星指挥外勤小队where I can quarterback the field teams via satellite.
万一出了岔子Someone's gonna have to pull your asses
总得有人去救你们out of the fire when things go south.
保持联络I'll be in touch.
看来我得去搭船了I guess I got a boat to catch.
祝你好运  科尔森特工Good luck, Agent Coulson.
你也是  西特韦尔特工You, too, Agent Sitwell.
这台手机上Okay, on this phone,
下载完成
有一组坐标  让你找到you will find a set of coordinates that'll lead you
我选出的三个千里眼人选之一to one of the three potential Clairvoyants I've chosen.
当你们到达一英里之内时When you're within a mile,
你的搭档就能在自己手机上your partner will be granted access
查看候选人的名字和档案to the candidate's name and profile on their own phone.
明白了吗Make sense?
我们还没有正式介绍过You know, we haven't officially met.
约翰·加勒特John Garrett.
躺在轮床上不省人事确实不能算数I guess lying unconscious in a gurney really should not count.
你感觉如何How are you feeling?
事实上  好多了A lot better, actually.
我也中过几次枪  背  肩I've been shot a couple times myself...back, shoulder.
还被割喉过一次Had my throat cut once.
但你知道最难熬的是哪次吗But you know the toughest one?
想像一下三级烧伤Thing about a third-degree burn...
烧伤部位一点也不疼the burn itself doesn't hurt at all.
很疯狂  对吧Crazy, right?
神经末梢被烤焦了The nerve endings get all fried.
但烧伤部位周围的区域  那才疼But the area around the burn? That smarts.
不过  腹部中枪最糟了Still, gut shot's the worst.
长官  我知道你为我做了什么Sir, I know what you did for me,
冒着生命危险救我how you risked your life to save me.
所以谢谢你So thank you.
你们团队很棒You've got a good team around you.
我只是跟着他们一起行动而已I just jumped on the bandwagon.
他们中有一个可是你训练出来的  长官Well, you trained one of them, sir.
看来我们兜了个圈Guess it all comes full circle.
沃德是你的监管人员  而我是他的Ward's your S.O., I was his.
兜兜转转Turn, turn, turn.
但是做监管人员的影响是双向的But this S.O. thing goes both ways.
你对他的影响很大You've had a big impact on him.
他和我记忆中的样子不同了He's different than I remember him.
怎样不同Different how?
做行动专家最艰难的部分就是要孤身一人Well, the tough thing about being a specialist is being alone.
而加入团队能改变你的视角A team gives you a whole new perspective.
我想这就是Guess it's the difference between
与之抗争和为之而战的区别吧fighting against something and fighting for something.
或是为谁而战Or someone.
沃德现在明白这一点了Ward's got that now.
多谢提供这个Thanks for this.
另外  斯凯  别叫我长官And, Skye, lose the "sir."
我是一名神盾局特工  和你一样I'm a S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent, just like you.
这是什么What's this?
假如你要标记一辆逃跑的汽车...Um, say you need to tag a fleeing vehicle...
或是想逃脱的野猴子or a wild monkey, if it was to get away from you.
这些子弹内置了微型接收器These rounds are built with a micro-receiver,
让你能通过卫星追踪你的目标which enables you to track your target via satellite.
我已经把所有血样结果压缩在一个加密文件里了I've condensed all the blood-sample results into an encrypted file.
如果我们能查阅...Now if we just had access to...
珍玛  我们有客人Jemma, we have a visitor.
梅  你好Oh. May. Hello.
你刚才说的是斯凯的血液吧I assume you're talking about Skye's blood.
有太多我们不了解的东西了There's just so much we don't know.
-GH325  -325- The GH-325. - 325.
我们不知道那是什么药物  来自哪里I mean, we don't know what drug it is, where it came from.
更别提可能存在的副作用Yeah, not to mention any potential side effects,
短期或者长期的short- or long-term.
我们只是担心斯凯We're just worried about Skye.
当然还有科尔森特工And Agent Coulson, of course.
他们俩有没有Have either of them
出现任何副作用或是有奇怪的举动呢exhibited any side effects or strange behavior?
-奇怪这个词很主观  -跟往常没区别- "Strange" is such a subjective term. - No more than usual.
如果他们现在  或以后出现了什么情况Because if they have, or if they do in the future,
可以随时先来找我feel free to contact me first.
我能帮忙  好吗I can help. Okay?
好  都给你弄好了Okay. You're all set.
希望你给我配了个好搭档Hope you paired me with someone good --
至少是个幽默风趣的or interesting, at least.
别担心了Stop worrying.
你的心思一眼就能看出来You wear your heart on your sleeve.
都摆在脸上了And your face.
我相信你的判断I trust your judgment.
你看世界的方式The way you see the world --
跟我们其他人不一样it's different than the rest of us.
所以我要你继续深挖That's why I want you to dig deeper into these.
心理评估
候选人的心理评估吗The candidates' psych evaluations?
千里眼认为他可以看透我们的思想The Clairvoyant thinks he can read our minds.
看看你能不能看透他See if you can read his.
我们需要了解这个人的内心世界We need some insight into who this person really is,
找出他的弱点a weakness.
做你会做的  找到弱点So, do what you do -- find the exploit.
还有  别担心了And stop worrying.
英国  米尔顿·凯恩斯监狱
加勒特说你们家很有背景So, Garrett says your family's like the cable version of the Kennedys.
我不信他会那么说I doubt he said that.
好吧  我自己做了点调查Fine. I did my own research.
没办法  得跟榜样学习嘛Had to, following in golden boy's footsteps.
你有什么要说的吗There a point to this?
只是想放松一下心情而已Just trying to keep things light.
我们现在需要的是这个吗'cause that's what we all need right now.
也许就是You know, maybe it is.
你想放松心情吗You want to keep it light?
千里眼差点杀了斯凯The Clairvoyant almost killed Skye.
是吗  他杀了我的搭档  丹·门罗Yeah? Well, he did kill my partner -- Dan Monroe.
一个好人  还有个儿子Great guy. Had a son.
你知不知道告诉一个六岁孩子You know what it's like telling a 6-year-old
他爸爸再也不会回家是什么感觉that his dad isn't coming home?
等我们找到千里眼So, we find the Clairvoyant,
你还是别挡我的道you might want to stay out of my way.
我们各有各的仇We all got axes to grind.
但我们是来抓他的  不是来杀他的But we're here to take him in, not out.
问问你自己  沃德特工Ask yourself something, Agent Ward --
如果斯凯没挺过来if Skye hadn't made it,
你现在会怎么想what would you be thinking right now?
以利亚·福德汉姆  32岁  军人出身Elijah Fordham, 32, military background.
看Here.
以利亚·福德汉姆
以利亚·福德汉姆
因90年代狂杀数人被判18次无期徒刑Serving 18 life sentences for a killing spree in the '90s.
说是有超能力  更像是疯子Sounds more psycho than psychic.
你是天蝎座吗You a Scorpio?
我只是想知道为什么我们的新晋特工I was just wondering why our newest agent
要把我们俩配在一起paired the two of us together.
佐治亚州  梅肯
一定是觉得我们在某方面合得来Must have thought we were compatible in some way.
是随机的  布莱克It was random, Blake.
你看起来像是天蝎座You seem like a scorpio.
你不相信有千里眼You don't believe in the Clairvoyant,
却相信星座but you believe in astrology.
我有我自己的理论I have some theories of my own.
宁静桥陪护中心
请告诉我咱们是来找一个医生的Please tell me we're here for one of the doctors.
印第安纳州  曼西
于是我从天窗下去So, I dropped down through the skylight,
用尽了全部子弹  然后用信号弹used up my whole mag, and hit the final guy
正中最后一人胸膛right in the chest with a flare gun.
你真该瞧瞧那玩意爆炸时Boy, you should have seen the look on his face
他脸上的表情when that thing went off.
怎么了What?
我跟你说过这事了I already told you that one?
-我当时在场  -什么时候加入的- I was there. - For which part?
一直都在The whole thing.
真的吗  看来我真是老了Really? Damn, I must be getting old.
要不就是我三十多时喝得太多脑子都浆糊了Either that or I drank a lot more in my 30s than I remember.
或是二者皆有  而且你当时没从天窗下去Or both. And you didn't go through the skylight.
我知道  但这样说更威风些I know, but it makes for a better story.
档案传来了File came in.
佐藤典子  19岁Noriko Sato, 19,
鲍尔州立大学大三学生junior at Ball State.
我记得她  那个大学生The co-ed -- I remember.
她智商超过二百She's got an I.Q. over 200.
都把我们派去审讯她的特工都耍得团团转Ran circles around every agent we sent in to interrogate her.
我们不知道她也有特殊能力We had no indication she was gifted.
不过她的家庭与日本极道有关系Family's got ties to the yakuza, though.
前面有情况Heads up.
得绕行Detour.
真令人意外啊Imagine that.
托马斯·纳什  在交通事故中受伤Thomas Nash. Injured in a head-on collision.
过去四年来一直患精神紧张症He's been catatonic for the past four years.
太好了  我们要找的是个植物人Great. We're here for a vegetable.
我去主任办公室看看I'll find the director's office.
你看看能不能问到纳什的房间号You get a room number on Nash.
遵命  女士Yes, ma'am.
空无一人  这也太奇怪了Nobody home. Odd.
这还真是巧啊Oh. Convenient timing.
你觉得这会成为我们又一则光辉事迹吗Think this'll make a good story someday?
后面来了个敌人  最好如此Ah. One behind us. You better hope so.
彼得森先生  住手Mr. Peterson...stop.
想想你儿子  艾斯You have a son -- Ace.
他需要你He needs you.
我们还能帮你的  麦克We can still help you, Mike.
麦克·彼得森已经死了Mike Peterson's dead.
梅呼叫中心May to Hub --
死亡战士在这里  布莱克受伤了Deathlok's here! Blake's down!
所有后援小队立即行动  有特工受伤All backup teams -- move in. We have an agent down.
我重复  布莱克特工受伤Repeat, Agent Blake is down.
中心  地点: 机密
幸好医疗小队及时赶到了现场Lucky the med team got to him when they did.
他现在情况危殆  我可不觉得这叫幸运I wouldn't call anyone in critical condition lucky.
死亡战士比我们想的更危险Deathlok's more dangerous than we thought.
布莱克朝他开了六枪  可似乎毫无作用Blake fired six shots -- didn't seem to faze him.
有托马斯·纳什的消息吗Any word on Thomas Nash?
没有  他毫无踪迹No, he's a ghost.
陪护中心把他登记为病人The facility has him listed as a resident,
但只是个幌子but it's all a cover-up.
纳什这会儿可能正在波拉波拉岛一边钓鱼Nash is probably off fishing in bora bora right now,
一边看我们笑话呢laughing at us.
但彼得森先生却知道你和布莱克And yet Mr. Peterson was waiting for you and Blake
会去那儿  为什么at the facility. Why?
或许跟他去袭击加勒特他们的原因一样Probably the same reason he came after Garrett --
我们接近真相了We're getting too close.
他想除掉我们He's trying to take us out.
这情况本不该发生的This shouldn't have happened.
后援小队本该与布莱克和梅特工一起行动Backup should have been there alongside Agents Blake and May.
那样千里眼就会预知我们的行动了Clairvoyant would have seen us coming.
看来他还是知道了It appears he did anyway.
这计划根本就有缺陷The plan was flawed from the start.
别这么说  维  这计划很周全Come on, Vic. The plan was solid.
一名特工受伤  就因为我们准备不足We have an agent down because we weren't prepared.
-布莱克很清楚风险  -还有别叫我"维"- Blake knew the risks. - And don't call me "Vic."
好像你高人一等It's condescending.
我们中任何一人都可能遭到伏击Any one of us could have been ambushed.
重要的是  布莱克还活着The point is, Blake's alive,
而我们也有了嫌疑人  托马斯·纳什and we have a suspect -- Thomas Nash.
我进去跟外勤小队说明情况I'm headed inside to prep the field teams.
科尔森特工  西蒙斯特工什么时候能来做汇报Agent Coulson, when can I expect Agent Simmons for debrief?
她正在做准备She's getting ready as we speak.
好  如果我要让更多特工去涉险Good. If I'm gonna put any more agents in danger,
我要他们清楚死亡战士到底是什么I want them to know exactly what Deathlok is
以及他有什么能耐and what he's capable of.
说真的  我不知道你还有什么可告诉他们的Honestly, I don't know how much more you can tell them.
谁知道他们又对他做了什么Who knows what else they've done to the man?
或者说他是人类的部分还剩多少Or how much man is left at all.
不管怎样  局里把我们看做是Regardless, S.H.I.E.L.D. sees us
调查死亡战士计划的常驻专家as the resident experts on the Deathlok Program.
如果他们想要我待在中心  那正好If they want me to stay here at the hub, then that's that.
你可真乐意离开这里Well, don't you seem awfully chipper
把我一个人扔下to pick up and leave me by my lonesome.
我有吗Do I?
当然有  也难怪Yes. No wonder.
或许是因为中心的各种设备Could it be because the hub's lab facilities
比我们这边要齐全得多are much more comprehensive than ours?
万一我想对斯凯的血样进行分子分解吗In case I'd like to run a molecular breakdown of Skye's blood?
没错  高明的推理  华生医生Yes. Brilliant deduction, Dr. Watson.
我总把你想象成我的华生I've always pictured you as Watson.
不管怎样  如果你真打算这么做Either way, if you're gonna do this,
你就需要我的帮助you're gonna need my help.
不论如何  这是迟早的事At some point, one way or another, eventually.
没到那个程度吧Well, I wouldn't go that far.
我回头建立一条加密线路  以便保持联系I'll jerry up an encrypted hard line so we can stay in touch.
可不能让飞机上其他人听到咱们在说什么Don't want the rest of the bus overhearing what we're saying.
准备好了吗You ready to go?
崔普利特特工Agent Triplett.
你也要待在中心吗Are you staying at the hub, as well?
没错  加勒特让我待在这儿Yes, Garrett's keeping me here.
向其他特工汇报我们之前遭遇死亡战士的事Help brief the teams on our most recent run-in with the cyber soldier.
不介意和我一起吧Don't mind the company, do you?
当然不介意No, not at all.
根据名录档案库According to Index archives,
神盾局已经注意纳什长达六年了Nash has been on S.H.I.E.L.D.'s radar for about six years.
神盾局  菲利克斯·布莱克
他本是加拿大的一名证券交易员Originally a bond trader in Canada,
业绩很不错doing very well for himself.
之后被加拿大政府招进一个Then the Canadian government recruited him
机密部门的项目to a secret department h-type program.
他们是想寻找具有超能力的人They were looking for people with psychic abilities.
尤其是那些能操纵人类行为的人Specifically people who could control human behavior,
而纳什宣称他天赋异禀and Nash claimed he had a gift.
-宣称  -根据记录- Claimed? - According to records,
他不能影响他人行为he couldn't affect a person's behavior.
但他偶尔能预测别人的行为But he could, on occasion, predict it.
但神盾局没把他纳入名录But S.H.I.E.L.D. crossed him off the index
因为车祸后他据信患上了紧张症after his accident because of his supposed catatonic state.
但他恢复得非常好Which he recovered from quite nicely.
这只是为甩掉神盾局而打的幌子It was all a lie just to throw S.H.I.E.L.D. off his scent.
你说布莱克开了几枪You said Blake fired how many rounds?
我听见了六声枪响  怎么了I heard six. Why?
因为这个弹夹里只少了五发子弹Because there are only five missing from this magazine.
这里面则少了一发And one from here.
这些是菲兹的信标子弹These are Fitz's tag rounds.
我们能追踪他We can track him.
-斯凯  马上搜索卫星信号  找到他  -好的- Skye, check all the sat feeds. Find that signal. - On it.
我去启动飞机I'll get us in the air.
干得漂亮  布莱克Nicely done, Blake.
佛罗里达州  彭萨科拉
封锁周边  每个出口派两人驻守I want this perimeter sealed. Two-man teams on every exit.
菲兹  有信号吗Fitz, you got a signal?
信号强度94%  长官94%, sir.
死亡战士肯定就在里面Deathlok must be inside somewhere.
里面会有平民吗Possible civilians inside?
不太可能Highly doubtful.
这个赛马场已经关闭了好几个月了This racetrack's been shut down for months.
行动Move out!
斯凯  你在指挥车里监控情况Skye, run a back end from the tactical van.
你要时刻守在斯凯旁边  保持警戒You, I want you 6 feet from Skye at all times, weapons hot.
沃德  不用这样  我能行的Ward, it's okay. I'm ready.
沃德说得对Ward's right.
我本来就不想你这么快参加行动I feel bad enough you're already back in the field.
我决不能再让你遭遇危险了I'm not taking any chances with your safety.
这不是什么伏击任务  各位This isn't a surprise party, people,
所以不用那么小心so you can toss stealth out the window.
目标身着护甲  还装备着强化人机武器Our target's wearing body armor and has enhanced cybernetics.
打准点Make your shots count.
出发吧Let's move.
你是要"摁门铃"还是"敲门"You ringing the bell or knocking?
当然要敲门Knocking, of course.
安全Clear!
菲兹  到你了Fitz, you're up.
狩猎时间到了  小伙子们It's time to hunt, boys.
去找个死亡战士出来吧Let's find us a Deathlok.
好厉害的玩具Impressive toy.
我更喜欢说高科技硬件I prefer the term "High-tech hardware."
斯凯  你在线吗Skye, you online?
等等Hang on.
西北走廊有发现Northwest Corridor is getting something.
我这就调出即时信号I'm pulling up a live feed.
我无法确认是他  启动多光谱叠加I can't confirm it's him. Initiating multi-spectrum overlay.
他们对他做了什么What the hell did they do to him?
你看到了什么What are you seeing?
不只是他的腿和眼睛It's not just his leg or his eye.
他们对他做了什么  都在他皮肤下面They did stuff to him. It's all under his skin.
信号中断了  寻回犬失灵了Uh, signal's dead. Retriever's down.
他知道我们来了He knows we're here.
菲兹  立刻回车上Fitz, get back to the van now.
快走Go, go.
锁定目标
目标已锁定
遭遇敌人  找掩护Contact! Take cover!
沃德  你没事吧Ward, are you okay?
我这边有两人受伤Uh, I got two men down.
-我们需要医疗小队  -这就调动医疗小队- We need a med team! - Requesting one now.
梅  他正朝你那边去May, he's coming your way.
看到他了Got him!
他躲进了西南的楼梯井He just ducked into the southwest stairwell.
正在追赶他In pursuit.
所有小队注意  他往地下室二层去了All teams -- he's headed into the sub-basement.
我没看见他I do not have a visual.
菲兹  这下面有寻回犬吗Fitz, you have a retriever down here?
这就派它们过去On their way.
别紧张Easy.
我不是来打架的I come in peace.
下次给我提个醒吧How about a signal next time?
菲兹  你看到了吗Fitz, you getting this?
勉强看得清  长官Uh, barely, Sir.
这里通向污水管道系统It leads down into the sewer system.
那里至少有12米厚的混凝土That's under at least... 40 feet of concrete?
在下面没信号的We'll be blind down there.
这小东西要去哪Where's that little guy going?
长官  下面还有其他人Sir, there's someone else down there.
收到Copy that.
搞什么啊What the hell?
科尔森特工  加勒特特工  我投降Agent Coulson, Agent Garrett, I surrender.
请原谅我不和你握手Forgive me if we don't shake hands.
我不喜欢被人碰I don't like to be touched.
长官  这里有很多线路Sir, we've got a lot of wires back here.
什么也别碰Don't touch anything.
我们要扫描房间里是否有爆炸物We need this room swept for explosives.
这里没有陷阱  科尔森特工There are no traps here, Agent Coulson.
你来到这儿是因为我们注定要见面You're here because we are destined to meet.
你就是千里眼吗You're the clairvoyant?
我叫托马斯·纳什I'm Thomas Nash.
波先生给我起了那个名字Mr. Po gave me that other name.
就我看来  有点夸张A bit dramatic for my taste.
大家提高警惕Eyes open, everybody.
我们不知道死亡战士在哪We don't know where Deathlok is
也不知道这儿是否还有其他人or who else is down here.
彼得森先生走了Mr. Peterson is gone.
我切断了他的信号  你们找不到他的I cut his feed, so you won't find him.
但你让他把我们引到这儿  为什么But you had him lead us here. Why?
好亲眼看到你So I could see you with my own eyes instead of his.
现在我明白为什么你死后我看不到你了Now I understand why I couldn't see you after you died --
因为你自己无法看见Because you, yourself, could not see.
你不过就是个有残缺的人You were simply a broken man
还对此毫不知情who did not know he was broken.
你不是也一样You're one to talk.
把这怪物送回冷藏库吧Let's pack this freak off to the Fridge where he belongs.
加勒特特工  看看我Agent Garrett, look at me.
我都摊在椅子上了  你还能怎么禁锢我Do you believe you can confine me any more than this chair?
谁能告诉怎么关掉那个讨厌的声音吗Can somebody please tell me how we turn that stupid voice thing off?
我会在监狱里跟蕾娜碰面  科尔森特工I will join Raina in your prison, Agent Coulson,
但无论你走到哪  我都能看到你but I will see you wherever you go,
正如我看到你抱着斯凯  她流着血just as I saw you holding Skye in your arms, bleeding...
渐渐死去dying...
而且觉得这都怪你knowing it was all your fault.
我们要把你关起来You're going away.
关在一个小盒子里We're gonna stick you in a little box
以后再不会有人听到你的胡言乱语where no one will ever hear you again.
我看得出你很生气I see you're angry.
被各种谎言蒙蔽Head clouded with lies.
有人背叛了你You've been betrayed,
现在你担心即将发生什么and now you fear what's about to happen.
不会有任何事发生Nothing's about to happen.
这只是你空洞的威胁罢了Just more empty threats from you.
不  这是不可避免的No. It is the inevitable.
一股你所不能理解的力量A force beyond your comprehension
正朝你袭来  你和斯凯is coming for you -- you and Skye.
她有我们想要的东西She has something we want.
我们得手时  她就会死And she will die giving it to us.
我已经预见了I have seen it.
下地狱去吧Go to hell.
不管我去哪里No matter where I go
不管你将对我做什么or what you do to me,
我会永远...I will always --
你做了什么What did you do?
等等  发生了什么事Wait. What just happened?
沃德是不是Did Ward just...
我的天呐Oh, my lord.
真不敢相信I can't believe it.
千里眼一定没预见这个Bet the clairvoyant didn't see that coming.
他死了He's dead.
一切都结束了It's over.
他是行动专家He's a specialist.
冷血是他们需要具备的基本素质Cold blood's a basic requirement.
我知道I know.
但我还是不敢相信沃德会这么做Still, I didn't think Ward would just do something like that.
当初我把他派给你Whole reason I sent him to you
就是希望你能改改他的臭脾气was to knock off the rough edges.
或许你做得太成功了Maybe you did your job too well.
如今他被情感蒙蔽了理智He let his emotions get the best of him.
要我押送他回中心接受询问吗You want me to escort him to the hub for debrief?
不  我想在他见审查委员会前先跟他谈谈No, I want to talk to him before he goes in front of the review board.
明白  那我去执行我的任务了Understood. I got my orders, then.
接着搜寻死亡战士的下落Got to stay on the hunt for Deathlok.
知道了  有消息及时通知我Copy that. Keep me in the loop?
我会的  你自己小心Will do. Take care.
还有  菲尔  别对那小子太狠了And, Phil, go easy on the kid.
刚刚收到总部的消息Just got a message from H.Q.
弗瑞局长回来了Director Fury's back.
他正在三曲翼总部等着你He's waiting for you at the Triskelion.
是时候了About damn time.
你可以跟他谈谈那件在困扰你的事You can talk to him about what's been bothering you.
困扰我的可不止一件事A lot's bothering me.
我还以为是科尔森Thought you were Coulson.
谢了Thanks.
你为什么要那么做Why'd you do it?
我失去理智了I lost it.
我很生气I got angry.
他说的那些话正中我的要害He pushed all the right buttons.
科尔森说过这次任务是生擒  而不是射杀Coulson said the mission was to capture, not to kill.
想想千里眼说的那些话  和做过的事Think about what the Clairvoyant said, what he's done.
想想蜈蚣计划Think about the centipede program,
他用麦克·彼得森那样的无辜者做试验How he experimented on innocent people like Mike Peterson,
他绑架并折磨了科尔森How he kidnapped and tortured Coulson,
下令让奎恩他射伤你How he ordered Quinn to shoot you.
他不会善罢甘休的  斯凯And he wasn't gonna stop, Skye.
除非你...Not until you...
我不能允许那种事发生I wasn't gonna let that happen.
那接下来你会怎样So, what happens now?
去见神盾局审查委员会I face a S.H.I.E.L.D. review board.
无论惩罚是什么  我都欣然接受Whatever the punishment, I'll take it.
这是我应得的I deserve it.
但我不后悔自己的决定But I don't regret what I've done.
-你不后悔吗  -不- You don't? - No.
只要能保证你的安全Not if it means you're safe.
你和我们其他队友You and the rest of the team.
接通了Yes.
菲兹Fitz?
别叫我的名字  珍玛Don't use my name, Jemma.
为什么不行Why not?
你不是...要用...加密线路吗I thought you said...going to use...crypted line.
-信号不好  等一下  -你在吗- You're cutting in and out. Hold on. - Were you there?
-沃德...怎么回事  -在  你说沃德- What happened...Ward? - Well, yeah. You said -- Ward.
我们都大吃一惊  等...Took us all by surprise. Hang --
继续说话  我看看能不能疏通信号Keep talking, okay? I'm gonna see if I can clear it up.
那么...不知道So...no idea...
我这边...简直一团乱Be...been a great deal of commotion on this end.
等一下  我好像发现问题了Hang on, now. I think I've found the problem.
看样子有别人切入了飞机通讯线路Looks like someone else is tapping the hard line.
等下  菲兹  好像...出事了Wait, Fitz..I think some...happening.
特工都在赶去战况室There's agents rushing to the situation room.
什么What?
珍玛Jemma?
珍玛  能听到吗Jemma, can you hear me?
真该死Oh...bloody hell.
能跟你谈谈吗Mind if I talk some stuff through with you?
你忙吗Are you busy?
我担心I'm worried.
担心沃德吗About Ward?
是啊I know.
不敢相信他就那样杀死了一个人I can't believe he just killed someone like that.
我担心他杀错了人I'm worried he killed the wrong man.
我们怎么知道就是他  他根本没开过口How do we know it was him? He never spoke.
都是电脑在替他说The computer spoke for him.
我们怎么知道是他在操控电脑How do we know he was the one controlling it?
你是说  纳什可能是在假扮千里眼Are you saying Nash could have been pretending to be the Clairvoyant?
我是说  纳什可能只是个傀儡I'm saying Nash could have been a prop.
而现在他死了And now he's dead.
几起袭击直接带我们找到了他After the attacks led us right to him.
整个调查干净利落地结束了The investigation all wrapped up in a neat little bow.
我觉得他可能还没落网I feel like he could still be out there right now,
窥探我们的大脑in our heads.
或是在窥探我们的档案Or in our files.
你让我查看那些心理评估时When you told me to check into the psych evals,
曾经说过  "看透他的思想"you said something. You said, "Read his mind."
于是我就开始思考And it got me thinking.
沃德说千里眼知道And Ward said that the Clairvoyant knew
怎么让他失控how to push all the right buttons.
蕾娜对我也是这样Raina did that to me, too.
她提到你父亲的死了吗Did she mention your father's death?
你的心理评估称其为"决定性的时刻"Your psych evaluation called it "a defining moment."
这些不止是性格测验These aren't just personality tests.
而是对每位特工的监控报告They're surveillance on every agent --
照片  状态  驻地在哪pictures, stats, where you've been stationed,
见过谁  喜欢在哪吃饭who you'd visit, where you'd like to eat.
里士满的晚餐Dinners at the Richmond.
他一直在监视我们  你想想He's been monitoring us. Think about it.
千里眼知道你在奎恩的别墅是在...The Clairvoyant only knew you'd be at Quinn's villa --
我激活追踪器后After I dropped the tracker.
他唯一看不到的And the only thing he's had trouble seeing
是你死后的事is what happened to you after you died.
因为弗瑞局长没把那份档案给任何人看Because Director Fury wouldn't release that file to anyone.
天呐No.
千里眼没有超能力The Clairvoyant doesn't have abilities.
他有的是安全权限He has security clearance.
他是神盾局特工He's an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.
长官  首先  我想说...Sir, first off, I want to say --
省省吧Save it.
我不想听你的道歉和借口I don't want your apologies. I don't want your excuses.
-我没想找借口  -我只想知道- I'm not making excuses. - The only thing I want to know
是你自己做的决定is whether you made the call yourself,
还是受人指使or did someone order you to do it?
什么What?
别装傻  沃德特工Don't play dumb, Agent Ward.
快回答我Just answer the question --
是不是有人指使你杀死千里眼did someone order you to kill the Clairvoyant?
梅May?
单独加密线路Another encrypted line.
你在搞什么  梅特工What are you up to, Agent May?
你在这儿干什么What are you doing here?
我只是在想...I was just wondering, since, uh --
因为我们要去三曲翼总部...'cause we're going to the Triskelion...
我想你会希望...Um, I thought you would like to, um...
着陆后会有一支飞行小队There's, uh, gonna be an aviation team on the ground.
他们也许可以帮你重新校准They could probably recalibrate it.
但我觉得...应该没关系But I think it's -- it should be all right.
-菲兹  -怎么了- Fitz. - What?
-我在找你  -为什么  我什么都没做- I was just looking for you. - Why? I didn't do anything.
-什么  我没说你做了  -什么- What? I didn't say you did. - What?
你做了什么What'd you do?
其实我不大确定Well, uh... I'm not quite sure, actually.
我刚才在航空设备区'Cause, um...I was just, um, um, doing maintenance
进行维护in the avionics bay before.
好吧Okay.
为什么梅  为什么梅Why would May -- why would May have
在驾驶员座舱有一条未授权加密线路an unauthorized encrypted hard line in the cockpit,
包括拇指扫描仪complete with a thumb scanner?
飞机的说明书里完全没有That isn't in any of the plane's specs.
慢点说  加密线路Slow down. An encrypted hard line?
是啊  连着一个接收器Yeah. Dedicated to one receiver.
她不该有那种东西  她在和谁交谈She's not supposed to have that. Who's she talking to?
-切断线路  -什么- Cut the line. - What?
你得立刻切断线路  菲兹You need to cut the line right now, Fitz.
别让她发消息出去Do not let her call out.
梅琳达·梅特工  更新日志95Agent Melinda May, update log 95.
你让我登上飞机I wasn't put on your plane
不是为了教我做个更好的人  科尔森so you could make me a better person, Coulson!
而是要我做出艰难的决定  我做了You put me here to make the hard call, and I made it.
我问的不是这个  沃德特工That's not what I asked you, Agent Ward.
我回答了你的问题I answered your question.
我没和任何人合作I wasn't working with anybody.
我为我自己的行为负全责I take full responsibility for my own actions.
那为什么  怎么了Then why -- what?
有麻烦了We have a problem.
放下Put it down.
放下  梅Put it down, May!
不是你想的那样  科尔森It's not what you think, Coulson.
这只是把冰冻枪It's just an icer.
这把不是  这是真枪实弹This one is not. It's real, with real bullets.
所以你最好放下枪So you better put yours down
告诉我到底是怎么回事and tell me what the hell's going on right now.
-我  -快点- I -- - Now!
我做不到I can't.
你最好听他的  梅特工You better listen to the man, Agent May.
你不知道自己在做什么You have no idea what you're doing.
也许是吧Maybe not.
但我知道你没有快到能干掉我俩But I know you're not fast enough to take us both.
听着Look...
我能解释一切I can explain everything.
但不是在这里But not here.
为什么Why not here?
你得先用驾驶员座舱里的You have to check with someone first,
加密电话跟别人商量吗using that encrypted phone in the cockpit?
电话的那一端是谁  梅Who's on the other end of that line, May?
我不能说I can't say.
没关系  我想我知道That's okay. I think I know.
难怪死亡战士把布莱克打成重伤It makes sense now why Deathlok put Blake in critical condition,
而你安然无恙  难怪他引我们去那儿left you alive and well, why he led us to the track
自己却消失了  而没有保护他的头儿only to disappear instead of defending his boss.
他为什么要那样做Why would he do that?
因为那不是他的头儿  对吧Because that wasn't his boss, was it?
对吧Was it?!
你在说些什么呢What are you talking about?
别对我撒谎了  你听谁的命令Stop lying to me! Who do you answer to?!
谁是真正的千里眼Who's the real clairvoyant?!
你做了什么  我们这是去哪What did you do? Where are we going?
我不知道  不是我干的  菲尔I don't know! I didn't do it, Phil!
我不知道这是怎么回事  我发誓I don't know what's happening here, I swear!
如果不是你做的  那是谁If you're not doing this, who is?
飞机降落后  干掉飞机上所有人When that plane touches down, take out everyone on board.
除了科尔森特工Except Agent Coulson.
他是我的He's mine.
