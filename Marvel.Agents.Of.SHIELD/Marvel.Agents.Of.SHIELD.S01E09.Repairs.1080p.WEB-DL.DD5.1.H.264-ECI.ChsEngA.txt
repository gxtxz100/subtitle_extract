神盾局特工第一季 第九集By aBu 201705
实验室事故  四人身亡
犹他州  贝茨维尔
有什么问题吗Is there a problem?
杰克·本森是我朋友Jack Benson was a friend of mine.
我很抱歉I'm -- I'm so sorry.
你是负责人  是吧You were the one in charge, right?
经理之类的Some kind of manager?
他也是我的朋友Uh, he -- he was my friend, too.
杰克的妻子说是你的错Jack's wife said it was your fault.
是真的吗That true?
算了  我不买了You know what? Um, never mind.
我去别的地方买I think I'm just gonna go somewhere else.
我问你问题呢I asked you a question.
别靠近我Stay away from me.
怎么回事What the hell?
是你干的吗You did that?
不  我发誓No, I -- I swear.
离我远点Get away from me!
不No.
主啊  求你  别又来啊Lord, please, not again.
有任务了We have a mission.
提细节了吗Any specifics?
没有No.
我们应该按之前的套路来Well, we should follow the same plan as before --
走不同的路线回去Take separate routes back,
错开时间  以防有人怀疑stagger our timing so no one suspects --
目标: 汉娜·哈金斯
等下  隔空移物Wait, a telekinetic?
不是说不存在吗I thought they didn't exist.
我们从未证实有过这样的人We never verified one.
所以我们要去一趟贝茨维尔That's why we're going to Batesville --
执行名录人员评估和纳入程序To conduct an index asset evaluation and intake.
是说我们去跟她谈谈  看她是否有超能力吗Does that mean we talk to her and see if she has powers?
基本上  是的Basically.
这事得取个好点的名字Well, that needs a better name --
不要太国税局风  改进一下Less I.R.S., more...better.
比如迎新队就不错Something like the welcome wagon.
你要对这个任务格外留心  斯凯I want you to pay close attention on this one, Skye.
这是一个学习如何应对It's an opportunity to learn
刚获得能力的人的好机会how to deal with someone with newfound abilities.
我又不是没应对过It's not like I've never done this before.
我比你们先找到了麦克·彼得森I found Mike Peterson before you did.
还记得捅出多大娄子吗Remember how that went?
这是你观察如何正确应对的机会This is a chance to see how it's done when it's done right.
这样的人你遇上过多少How many people like this have you encountered?
有那么几个A handful.
名录上其实没那么多人There's not that many people on the index.
他们看到神盾局的车开来  肯定抓狂极了They must wig out when they see the S.H.I.E.L.D. trucks roll up.
每个案子的情况都有所不同Each case is different.
有些人根本不肯承认Some people are in complete denial
自己有任何异常that there's anything unusual about them.
这过程很棘手  从各方面报告来看It's a delicate process, and from all reports,
这次的案例尤为敏感this sounds like a particularly sensitive situation.
"粒子加速器爆炸""Particle accelerator explodes."
汉娜·哈金斯  是其中一名质量控制工程师Hannah Hutchins, one of the quality-control engineers.
是她的错吗Was it her fault?
镇上的人把责任推给了她The town blames her.
四名技术员在她的看管下在爆炸中丧命  Four technicians died in that blast -- on her watch.
太惨了  那些家庭真可怜That's terrible -- all those families.
实验室爆炸的四名遇难者
小教会社区  现在人心惶惶Small church community -- they're pretty rattled.
她肯定也很慌张She must be, too.
朋友  同事死掉  不止如此Friends, co-workers dead, and on top of all that,
她或许还得到了她不了解的疯狂能力she might have some crazy power she can't understand.
或是无法控制Or control.
长官  能源部表示Sir, the department of energy's declared
粒子加速器实验室太危险  不能进入the particle acceleration lab too dangerous to enter.
但好消息是But the good news is,
我们应该可以用小飞行器we still think we can retrieve the disaster-event data
获取灾难数据from the instruments.
我们会判定事故原因We'll determine the cause and
看看隔空移物的自发形see if there's any correlation between telekinesis
成与粒子加速器爆炸有无关系spontaneously forming and a particle accelerator exploding.
毕竟制造小型宇宙大爆炸Well, it does use giant magnets to fire billions of
是利用巨型磁铁发射数十亿亚原子粒子subatomic particles into their anti-particles at the speed of light
以光速与反粒子对撞to create miniature big bangs,
所以这个着手点挺合适so seems like a good place to start.
我也读书的I read.
我们跟哈金斯谈爆炸的事时I'll try not to mention big bangs
还是尽量别提什么宇宙大爆炸吧when we talk to Hutchins about the explosion.
你留在车里You'll stay in the car.
此次情况很微妙This is a delicate situation.
我们不确定这个女人的危险性We don't know what kind of danger this woman poses,
我跟沃德特工和梅特工先去接触她so I'll make initial contact with Agents Ward and May.
五分钟后起飞Wheels up in five.
系好安全带Better strap in.
因为情况微妙It's a delicate situation,
所以你要带"笑咪咪"和"好脾气"去吗so you're bringing along warm and fuzzy?
大家好Hey, guys.
你迟到了You're late.
我们知道你做了什么We know what you did.
她炸掉了那间加油站She blew up that gas station.
你们怎么还不逮捕她Why aren't you arresting her?
警官  你能不能想办法Officer, is there anything you can do
让这些人散了to get these people to disperse?
试过了  但这是他们的自由Been trying, but it's a free country.
哈金斯小姐  我是科尔森特工Miss Hutchins, I'm Agent Coulson.
我们专门处理奇异事件We specialize in strange occurrences
就像你遇到的那种like the ones you've encountered.
你是要把我关起来吗You've come to lock me up?
只是想谈谈To talk.
那又有什么用呢Well, what good will that do?
滚出这里Get out of here!
我们不要你留在这儿We don't want you here anymore.
警官  让这些人退后Officers, get those people back.
闪开  快闪开Move it! Get out of the way.
是她干的  那个怪胎想杀死我们It's her! That freak just tried to kill us!
冷静点Calm down.
别冲动  警官Easy, officer.
把枪放下Put the gun down.
放过我吧Leave me alone.
-哈金斯小姐  请冷静  -不是我干的- Miss Hutchins, please calm down. - It wasn't me.
请冷静  我们不会让任何人伤害你的Please calm down. We're not gonna let anyone hurt you.
该走了Time to go.
还说要做迎新队呢So much for the welcome wagon.
我们不相信人类能隔空移物  对吗We don't believe that people have telekinetic powers, do we?
粒子加速站  闲人勿入
梅不得不使用了麻醉枪May was forced to sedate her.
那女人移动了一辆警车  用她的意念The woman made a police car move -- with her mind.
没有证据能证实...There's no principal that would support --
隔空移物  目前还没有Telekinesis. Not yet.
但我们有次真信了  记得吗We did believe for a bit, though, remember?
大一的时候Freshman year?
莎莉·韦伯在神经生物学课上When Sally Webber made the books
把书从桌子上弄了下去fall off the table in neurobiology?
那是个很残忍的恶作剧Oh, well, that was a particularly cruel prank.
你尖得像个姑娘似的You screamed like a girl.
我就是个姑娘I am a girl.
提前三年毕业就是这点不好You know, that's the one drawback of graduating three years early --
我们都没机会捉弄哪个新生we never to pull any freshman pranks on anyone else.
菲兹Fitz...
斯凯没进过学院Skye never went to the academy.
她就是个新生She's a freshman.
一个天真的小新生A wide-eyed little freshman.
而且被整蛊是成为神盾局特工不可缺少的经历And being pranked is an integral part of becoming a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent.
必须的Well, mandatory, really.
何不给她一个完整的神盾局学院体验呢Why not give her the full S.H.I.E.L.D. academy experience?
剥夺她这个权利多不公平It would be unjust to deny her such a thing.
信息数据上传完毕  我们走吧  Information data uploaded. Let's get going.
是  长官Yes, sir.
只有个垫子吗  长官Just a mattress, sir?
离达冷藏库还有六小时的航程呢It's a six-hour-long ride to the Fridge.
上次西蒙斯出事后  菲兹给牢笼加了磁屏蔽Fitz added magnetic shielding to the cage after Simmons had her scare.
如果哈金斯小姐真有超能力If Miss Hutchins has this power,
那个房间应该能控制住她then that room should keep it from getting out,
但在那里面but in there,
她还是个危险人物she'll be just as dangerous.
她怎么样了How is she?
树眼镜蛇毒素的药效正在消退The dendrotoxin's wearing off.
她很快就会醒过来She'll be awake soon,
待在陌生的房间里  心惊胆战scared, in a strange room.
接下来与她的接触对取得她的信任至关重要Our next interaction with her is crucial to gaining her trust,
所以我想让你来which is why I want you there.
你确定要这么做吗Are you sure that's a good idea?
如果想要哈金斯小姐相信我们的话If miss Hutchins is gonna believe anything we say,
就得让她知道我们对她没有任何隐瞒she needs to know we're not hiding things from her,
所以要由你which means you
去说明当前的情况explaining the situation.
如果这不能让她冷静下来呢What if that doesn't calm her down?
如果这让她更不安了呢What if that makes her more agitated?
那他更希望我在场了Then he definitely wants me in there.
是啊Pretty much.
我在这儿看着I'll observe from out here.
我去把领带解了And I'll lose the tie.
如果她真会隔空移物If she is telekinetic,
我还是别套着绳索进去I don't want to have a noose around my neck.
给你带了瓶水Brought you some water.
没事的It's okay.
我叫菲尔I'm Phil.
这位是梅琳达·梅This is Melinda May.
我怎么会在这里How did I get here?
我给你打了镇静剂I sedated you.
很抱歉用这种方式带你来I apologize for bringing you in that way.
当时局面在失去控制Things were escalating.
也是为了大家的安全It was for everyone's safety.
大家的安全Everyone's safety.
好啊Good.
好吧Okay.
主啊  我做了什么啊Oh, lord, what have I done?
我向你保证  哈金斯小姐I promise you, miss Hutchins...
刚刚没人受伤Nobody was hurt back there.
不管我到哪里  都会出事Wherever I go, things turn bad.
刚刚在屋外时  你生那些人的气吗Were you angry at those people, back at the house?
生气  没有Um, angry? No.
他们大多数人我都认识I know most of them.
生气的是他们They were angry.
我能理解I understand.
天啊Oh, god.
弗兰克的妻子Frank's wife --
她看我的那种表情the way she was looking at me.
弗兰克·德拉科Frank Delacort.
他在事故中遇难了He died in the accident.
他们的死都是因为我Because of me, they're gone.
是我害死了他们I killed them.
真让人难受So sad.
而且很正常And normal.
这些读数完全在平均范围内These readings are entirely within average ranges.
当然  漫无目的地看Of course, it's hard to find something
很难找到些什么when you don't know what you're looking for.
这些脑电波只能表明她现在很不安All I can tell from these brain waves is she's upset.
这还用电脑分析吗You need a computer for that?
梅在里面  那个朝她开枪的女人May's in there -- the woman who shot her.
只是打镇静剂Sedated her.
场面要失控了Things got out of hand.
梅控制住了May sorted it out.
她是铁骑She's the cavalry.
话说  那称号是怎么来的Where does that name come from, anyway?
-沃德没告诉你吗  -你不知道吗- Didn't Ward tell you? - You don't know?
当然不知道Of course not.
你没进过神盾局学院嘛You spent no time at the academy.
这故事可传奇了It's quite a story.
沃德不是个爱闲聊的监管人员Yeah, well, ward isn't exactly a chatty S.O.
那你就想象一下吧Well, imagine if you will...
一座重兵把守的院子...A heavily secured compound.
位于巴林的麦纳麦Manama, Bahrain.
数名神盾局特工被挟持为人质Multiple S.H.I.E.L.D. agents are taken hostage,
遭受严刑拷问tortured for information.
梅的任务就是May's mission --
消灭威胁eliminate the threat.
你是说杀人吗You mean kill people.
不是普通人Not people --
是整支雇佣兵小队entire squads of mercenaries,
近一百人almost 100.
超过一百人More than 100.
超过一百个全副武装的士兵More than 100 men, heavily armed.
她的车被毁了  所以她骑马进去了Her vehicle got totaled, so she rode in.
而且手持两把M249型轻机枪And, um, she had a M249 in each hand.
没错  两只手各持一把Right...in each hand.
她骑在马背上冲了进去And she rode in on a horse.
由此得名...Hence the name...
铁骑the Cavalry.
是真的吗Is this real?
她单枪匹马就消除了敌方威胁She eliminated the enemy threat single-handedly.
那天她目睹了各种惨状She saw a lot of hurt that day.
所以她才那么...Is that why she's so...
乐呵吗Happy?
粒子加速器数据载入中Particle accelerator data loading.
住手No!
你不可以碰那个You do not touch that.
至少得学两个学期的全息工程学Two semesters minimum of holographic engineering
-才可以碰这个  -好啦  好啦- before you get to touch this! - All right, all right.
我明白了I get it.
我没上过你们的神盾魔法学院I didn't go to your stupid S.H.I.E.L.D. Hogwarts or whatever.
我上楼去了I'm gonna go upstairs.
用我烦人的普通旧电脑...And I'm gonna do my own research on computer --
做我自己的调查my boring, old, flat computer.
她居然连这都信Can you believe she bought that?
骑马...简直太聪明了A horse -- brilliant.
你想好下一个恶作剧了吗You think you have the next prank?
优良传统必须传承下去We must carry on the tradition.
没错Yeah.
连续几周  我都收到二区的报告For weeks, I was getting reports from section two
称耦合组件的螺栓松动complaining that the coupling assembly was coming loose at the bolts.
托拜厄斯是...Tobias is the...
他是那里的技术员he was the technician down there.
我们换掉了部件We replaced the part,
并再三进行探伤and we triple-checked it for damage.
我似乎每隔几天就要去一趟Seems like I went down there every few days.
你发现问题了吗Did you find a problem?
没有No.
但显然我是漏掉了什么But clearly, I missed something.
我的团队正在研究到底发生了什么My team is working to determine what really did happen
以及你身上可能发生了什么and what might have happen to you.
我身上吗To me?
什么意思What do you mean?
我们认为事故或许导致你We believe that somehow, as a result of the accident,
获得了隔空移物的能力you acquired some form of telekinetic ability.
你觉得那是我干的吗You think it's me?
那辆警车  加油站...你觉得是我做的吗The police car, the gas sta...you think I did that?
我们不确定  这可能让人难以接受We're not sure, and this can be a hard thing to hear,
但这些事件都只有一个共同点but all these events have one thing in common.
那就是我  但那都不是我干的Me, but I'm not causing it.
不是我It's not me.
我倒希望是我  那样我也许还能想办法阻止I wish it were because then maybe I could make it stop.
但如果不是你  那是谁But if it's not you, then what is it?
说出来你们也不会相信You people won't believe me.
说说看Try me.
上帝在惩罚我God's punishing me.
他遗弃了我He abandoned me.
他不再保护我了He doesn't protect me anymore.
所以才会变成这样That's why this is happening.
保护你不被什么伤害Protect you from what?
恶魔  长官Demons, sir.
恶魔在纠缠我I'm being haunted by demons.
创伤之后产生迫害妄想症十分常见Delusions of being persecuted aren't uncommon after trauma.
她受的创伤绝对不小She's certainly been through her fair share.
她在责备自己  是内疚She's blaming herself. It's guilt.
就是这样  她伤透了心It's all of it. She's broken.
仔细研究事故现场Pore over the accident site.
如果是惨案给了她能量  我们得关掉它If that tragedy gave her powers, we need to shut them down.
如果不是她的错  那再好不过If it wasn't her fault, even better,
不过在确定之前  她对我们都很危险but until then, she's a danger to all of us.
让我去和她谈谈  长官  以朋友的身份Just let me go in and talk to her, sir, as a friend.
我不能让你那么做  太危险了I can't let you do that. It's too dangerous.
她不危险She's not dangerous.
她人很好...有点太好了She's nice...like, overly nice.
她从不忘记给朋友送上生日祝福She never misses a birthday post to her friends,
在教堂承办青少年项目runs the youth program at her church,
拯救狗狗rescues dogs.
汉娜是一名安全检查员Hannah's a safety inspector
不仅仅是因为她注重细节not just because she's detail-oriented
更是由于她...but because she...
-她是真的很在乎  -没错- She genuinely cares. - Right.
一个如此有同情心的人And someone with that much empathy
要为这么多条人命负责being responsible for that much loss of life,
她肯定心如死灰she's devastated,
说什么这是上帝在惩罚她...Spouting nonsense about God punishing her for --
人们相信他们想相信的事People believe what they need to believe
为自己的行为开脱to justify their actions.
所以你都二话不说就开枪吗Is that how you justify your shoot-first policy?
至少让我试着弥补这件事的伤害At least let me try to repair that damage.
在我们弄清楚她到底是怎么回事之前Until we figure out what's going on with her,
她必须被关起来  你也不准靠近她she stays locked up and you stay away.
那东西不是固定在架子上的吗Thought that was glued down.
你的想法很不错  斯凯You're asking the right questions, Skye,
但目前  你只能做这么多but for now, that's all you get to do.
我很抱歉I'm sorry.
我真不理解她I just don't understand her at all.
她眼里就只有"锁定目标"Everything to her is just target acquired.
"威胁解除"Threat eliminated.
她是行动专家Well, she's a specialist.
这一方面  几句好话往往比暴力In one thing, you can catch a lot more flies with honey
更能解决问题  我就这么一说than with napalm -- just saying.
把生菜给我Hand me the lettuce.
她让我别插手And she says I need to stay away,
但你知道我怎么想的吗but you know what I think?
我觉得她需要找个男人发泄一下I think she needs to get laid.
你最好还是少惹梅特工Might want to be less confrontational with Agent May.
我可不怕她I'm not scared of her.
好吧  有点怕  但就算"铁骑"Well, I am, but just because the cavalry
能骑马射杀一百余人shot 100 guys on horseback
她也还是不懂人心doesn't mean she knows how people work.
等等  骑马Wait, horseback?
你哪听来的Where'd you hear that?
菲兹-西蒙斯Fitz-Simmons.
他们在忽悠你吗Were they messing with you?
这故事每年都越传越夸张Story gets bigger every year.
不是100人  只是20个It wasn't 100 guys -- it was 20.
训练有素的杀手Trained assassins.
梅消灭了他们May crossed them off with
只用一把手枪  无人支援one pistol, no support.
她是为了营救一群特工吗She rescued a bunch of agents?
这故事里绝对没有马There definitely wasn't a horse.
如果任务那么顺利Well, if it went so well,
她为什么对这个外号那么反感why's she so squirrelly about the name?
梅不是个热衷名誉的人Well, May's not in it for the glory.
她只是完成了自己的任务  就是这样She got the job done. End of story.
我把刀放哪去了Where'd I do with that knife?
放过我吧Leave me alone!
上帝  请饶恕我Oh, God, please forgive me!
这一定就是报告中提到的耦合组件This must be the coupling from the reports.
老天  那个技术员说得没错Oh, dear. The technicians were right.
你听我说话了吗Were you even listening?
你真一点都没被我吓到吗You weren't even a wee bit scared?
更多是觉得失望More disappointed, really.
没关系It's fine. It's fine.
这只是试验阶段  是的  我听到了I'm just workshopping here, and, yes, I was listening.
我正准备去把我们的磁耦合器拿来I was about to go fetch our own magnetic couplings
做模拟实验to run simulations.
那你顺便Oh, well, while you're in there,
再给汉娜拿点镇静剂来grab some more diazepam for Hannah.
她可能需要更大的剂量She may need to be more heavily sedated.
你的恶作剧也得再下点功夫And the prank needs more work, as well.
我知道I know.
我只是在做各种尝试I'm trying different things.
时机才是关键  西蒙斯It's the timing that matters, Simmons.
我们一定不能让斯凯起疑心Skye can't suspect a thing.
实验室意外致四人死亡  唯一幸存者受质疑
职工名单  托拜厄斯·福特
沃德  来看看这个Ward, come look at this.
托拜厄斯·福特Tobias Ford.
他不是遇难的技术员之一吗Oh, isn't he one of the technicians who died at the plant?
是的  事故前一个月他三次Yeah, and he filed three safety complaints
向汉娜所在部门提交了安全隐患投诉in the past month, each one in Hannah's department.
汉娜当他是朋友She thought he was a friend.
但他对她很不满But he had it out for her.
不幸的是  他是对的Sad part is... he was right.
耦合组件Oh. Couplings.
耦合  耦合Couplings, couplings.
对了Yes.
这个就行了That'll do actually...
这我用得上啊Now, this I could use.
现在就只需要一截麻绳All I need now is a little bit of twine
和一个不知情的倒霉蛋了and an unsuspecting victim.
这真太棒了Oh, that's fantastic, that is.
好奇怪Well, that's odd.
天呐My god.
菲兹  看这个Fitz, look at this.
这是什么啊What are we seeing here?
爆炸似乎是扯开了一个裂口  通向...It's as if the explosion tore open some sort of window to --
地狱To hell.
西蒙斯  你没事吧Simmons! Are you okay?
长官  汉娜说的是真的Sir, Hannah's telling the truth.
她没有隔空移物能力She's not telekinetic.
飞机上还有一个人There's someone else on this plane.
怎么回事What was that?
飞机断电了Plane's lost power.
我们要下坠了We're going down.
沃德  你有飞行执照吗Ward, you certified?
机动发动机呢What about engine-driven generators?
那些也不能用了Those are dead, too.
开启电池维持飞行控制Switch batteries to maintain flight controls.
剩下的需要用来维持牢笼的屏蔽状态The rest will be needed to keep the cage shielded.
副翼  十Flaps -- 10.
-放下起落架  -我能做什么- Lower landing gear. - What can I do?
系好安全带Buckle up.
前方有大小合适的区域可降落There's a decent-sized field up ahead,
但会很颠簸but it's gonna be rough.
垂直降落失灵了Vertical landing's out.
冲得太猛Coming in a little hot.
我可以的I got it.
我们的入耳式通讯器是通过飞机转接的Our ear comms are usually relayed through the plane,
拿上对讲吧so here's some hardware.
是那姑娘干的吗  长官Did the girl do this to us, sir?
我们认为哈金斯小姐也是受害者We believe Miss Hutchins is the victim here.
我们关于她有超能力的理论是错的Our theories about her powers have been disproved.
谁说的By who?
我看到了一个鬼I saw a ghost.
我知道听起来不可思议I -- I know how it sounds,
但一个男人袭击了我  然后就消失了but a man attacked me, and then he disappeared.
你看清楚他了吗Did you get a good look at him?
他就那么消失了He dematerialized!
梅  运行系统检查May, run your systems checks.
牢笼还处于屏蔽状态吗Is the cage still shielded?
大部分电能都供给它了Most of the power dedicated to it.
这个人或者不知道什么东西This man or whatever he is
一直在折磨哈金斯小姐has been tormenting Miss Hutchins.
现在大概只有牢笼能保护她了The cage might be the one thing protecting her now.
我们去通知她We'll inform her.
长官  能让我去跟汉娜谈吗Sir, can it be me to talk to Hannah?
她的生活被搅得天翻地覆Her life has been turned upside down,
我们还把她关在一个可怕的笼子里and we stuck her in a nightmare box.
她以为这是她的报应She thinks she's being punished.
求你让我去传达这个好消息吧Can I please be the one to deliver the good news?
一个没有物质形态的疯子想抓她吗That a non-corporeal madman is hunting her?
再说一遍  我觉得还是我去说比较好  真的Again, I think it'd be better coming from anyone else, really.
好吧All right.
我去楼上I'll head upstairs,
启动紧急无线电收发机联系总部activate the emergency transceiver, and radio HQ.
沃德  拿上抢Ward, take a firearm.
陪菲兹-西蒙斯下楼Escort Fitz-Simmons downstairs,
评估损坏程度  恢复正常运行assess the damage, get us up and running.
等一下Wait.
各位  菲兹呢Guys, um, where's Fitz?
有人吗Hello?
有没有人啊Can anybody hear me?
到底什么情况啊What the hell's happening?
我们坠机了吗Did we crash?
刚才是谁在叫Who was screaming?
如果这是恶作剧  那一点都不好笑  珍玛This is not funny, Jemma, if this is a prank.
这肯定是个恶作剧This is a prank.
聪明Clever.
西蒙斯Simmons?
快点  开灯Come on. Turn on the lights.
谢天谢地  你去哪了Thank God. Where have you been?!
我被锁在小房间里  要崩溃了I have been locked in a closet freaking out,
我谢谢两位天才啊thanks to you two geniuses.
不是我们That wasn't us.
那是谁啊Well, then, who was it?
我们找到菲兹了We found Fitz.
很好  我们需要他Good, we'll need him.
看来主要问题在二号航空舱Looks like the main problem is in avionics bay two.
但他把我们整个系统都搞瘫痪了But he took out all our systems.
她说谁呢Who's she talking about?
带上设备过去吧Grab your equipment and get in there.
我先切断飞行控制电源节约电能I'm going to power down flight controls to conserve energy
应急系统
然后去牢笼门口守着and then go defend the cage door
以防鬼敲门in case this ghost comes knocking.
她刚才说的是"鬼"吗Did she just say "Ghost"?
求救  求救Mayday, Mayday.
北部地区  这里是神盾616号Region north, this is S.H.I.E.L.D. 616.
我们电力中断并已着陆We've lost electrical and are grounded.
正在测算当前坐标   请求支...  Calculating coordinates, requesting supp--
发生故障
90年代的设备能这样就不错了1990s technology at its best.
汉娜Hannah?
谁Who's there?
我是斯凯My name is Skye.
我们还没见过We haven't met yet.
我们坠机了  对吗We crashed, didn't we?
你们受伤了吗Are you all hurt?
真对不起I'm so sorry.
不不  我们都没事No. No, no, no. We're okay.
不管发生了什么  不是你的错Whatever's happening, it's not your fault.
是我们错了We were wrong.
但是安全起见你得待在里面But you need to stay in that room so that you're safe.
外面  有不好的东西Something... bad is out here.
恶魔Demons.
我不知道是什么I don't know what it is.
你相信上帝吗Do you believe in God?
说实话Honestly?
我不信Not really.
可我信Well, I do.
我知道上帝在惩罚我  我是罪有应得And I know that he's punishing me, and I deserve it.
不  不是的No. No, you don't.
没人该受惩罚No one does.
我小时候  身边有些修女I had a few nuns around me growing up,
她们就喜欢这么说and they would talk like that,
讲什么上帝的愤怒来吓唬孩子scaring kids with stories of God's wrath.
搞得我不想相信了It made me not want to believe.
我唯一记住的就是The only words that stuck with me were
麦肯娜修女说的something that sister McKenna said
应该是《圣经》上的from the Bible, I think.
她说"上帝即是爱"She said, "God is love."
虽然简单  还有点傻It's simple and it's a little sappy,
但我喜欢这个说法but that's the version I like.
上帝即是爱God is love...
是爱支撑了我们The thing that holds us together.
如果这是真的And if that's true,
我不认为他会因为你犯错了就惩罚你I don't think he would punish you for making a mistake.
我觉得他会原谅犯错之人I think he'd forgive a mistake.
我也想相信你说的  真的I want to believe that. I do.
从现在起我来站岗I'll stand guard now.
科尔森需要人帮他弄紧急收发器Coulson needs help with the emergency transceiver.
我想在这里多待一会儿I would rather stay here for a while --

这是命令That's an order.
需要的话随时叫我  好吗I'll nearby if you need me, okay?
不要再给她更多的伤害了  梅特工Try not to hurt her any more than you already have, Agent May.
他觉得是地狱  但我觉得是外星世界He thinks it's hell, but I think it's an alien world.
菲兹  多令人震惊啊Fitz, it was stunning.
伦敦有报道说Well, there were reports in London
飞船降落后  有数扇传送门打开after the spaceship landed of multiple portals opening,
托尔穿梭于各界之间Thor passing between worlds.
你觉得他们实验室就在研究这个吗You think that's what they were researching at that lab?
想创造另一扇传送门  没错Trying to create another portal, yes.
但一直没成功  直到事故产生了一大股能量Failing until a malfunction produced a burst of energy.
这个"鬼"可能是一个This "Ghost" is a man trapped
被困于地球和其它空间之间的人between our universe and another.
可能所有的鬼都是如此Perhaps that's how all ghosts are.
这样解释更简单It's a simple explanation, really.
就目前而言  简单是相对的Simple would be a relative term in this case.
我的天啊Bloody hell.
他破坏得很彻底啊He was thorough.
天呐Oh, God.
飞机降落在不平的地面上Plane's on uneven ground.
可能是机身在晃动Could just be settling.
或是另外那个东西Or the other thing.
去干活儿Get to work.
安全Clear.
沃德  救命Ward, help!
安静Quiet.
救命Help!
看来是硬件问题  不是软件Seems like a hardware issue, not firmware.
而且  我该和汉娜待在一起I should be with Hannah, anyway.
难怪她在里面不停地尖叫No wonder she keeps screaming in there.
你老是派铁骑去You keep sending in the Cavalry,
肯定会得到这种反应you're bound to get a reaction like that.
别这么叫她Don't -- don't call her that.
为什么不Why not?
射杀100个巴林人可不是普通人...No normal person can shoot 100 Bahraini--
事情不是那样的That's not how it went down.
好吧  那就是20个Whatever, 20.
我就是搞不懂...I just -- I don't understand --
她没有枪She didn't have a gun.
我们都没有None of us did.
而且那也不是一次营救或突袭行动And it wasn't a rescue or an assault,
或是学院里现在流传的版本whatever they say at the academy these days.
我们是迎新队We were the welcome wagon.
但出了岔子And it went south.
有多少人...How many --
很多Plenty.
一个平民女孩和我们的一些人A civilian girl and a few of our guys
被困在了一栋楼里were stuck inside a building,
那个有超能力的人的追随者或者说崇拜者being held by the followers of this gifted individual --
挟持了我们or worshippers.
我们后来也没能查明真相We never found out.
但梅知道了May did.
她就凭一己之力去营救他们She took it upon herself to get them out.
她说她能把问题解决Said she could fix the problem.
所以她就去了  消灭了所有敌人So she went in, crossed off the enemy force.
但没说是怎么做到的Didn't say how.
她失去了谁吗Did she lose anyone in there?
她自己Herself.
梅原来不是这个样子的May used to be different.
她一向很安静  但是...She was always quiet, she just...
她以前很热心She was warm.
是另一种无畏的样子  总是惹麻烦Fearless in a different way, getting in trouble,
搞恶作剧  认为规则就是用来打破的pulling pranks, thought rules were meant to be broken.
听起来耳熟吗Sound familiar?
但她走出那栋楼的时候But when she walked out of that building...
就好像她失去了那部分自我It was like that part of her was gone.
我试着安慰她I tried to comfort her,
但她不愿告诉我当时到底发生了什么but she wouldn't tell me what went down in there.
你都说了什么What did you say?
我以为她想听到的话I said the words I thought she needed to hear.
所以你才想让她加入It's why you want her on the plane --
你想看看那个曾经的梅还在不在to see if that person is still in there somewhere.
锁卡住了The lock is jammed.
让我进去或者放她出来Let me in or let her out.
-这不由我们说了算  -放她出来- That's not up to us. - Let her out!
跟我说一下情况Talk to me. What's happening?
梅  他在不停消失May, he's disappearing.
他在不同世界中穿梭He's passing between worlds.
似乎他每次出现都会丢失更多自我It seems a little less of him is returning every time he appears.
但他为什么追着你们不放But why is he after you guys?
因为他没法抓到汉娜Because he can't get to Hannah in there.
她很安全She's safe.
如果我们拖下去  没准他就会完全消失了If we wait it out, maybe he'll disappear fully.
你要做什么What are you going to do?
解决问题Fix the problem.
我们必须想办法出去We got to find a way out of here.
这堆东西还有能用的吗Any of this crap still work?
他醒了There he is.
发生了什么What happened?
我们失去了通讯联系Well, we lost communication.
你被一个很大的钳子打晕了And you were hit with a very large plumber's wrench.
钳子A wrench?
是的Yeah.
那家伙带着个钳子That guy's traveling back and forth
在外星世界间穿梭between alien worlds with a wrench?
一定是爆炸发生的时候就拿在他手里Must have been in his hand when the blast hit.
不会是用来松耦合组件的钳子吧Not the kind of wrench you would use to loosen a coupling, is it?
有人吗...there?
也许不好使Maybe it doesn't work after all.
是的  长官  我们在Uh, yes, yes, we're here, sir.
你去哪里了Where'd you go?
哪也没去Nowhere.
我们遭到了袭击  被锁在里面了We were attacked, locked in,
然后那人就消失了then the guy disappeared.
跟我们的情况一样Hey, that's our story.
梅和你们在一起吗Is May with you guys?
她没和你们在一起吗She isn't with you?
我不想吓唬你  只是要用你来做饵I don't mean to scare you, I just need to use you as bait.
真令人宽慰Well, that's comforting.
把他引出来  远离我的同事To draw him out, away from my people.
然后你打算怎么做Then what will you do?
不惜一切代价阻止他Whatever I have to.
你确定是这么做吗You're sure this is how to do it?
是的Yes.
我将信号放大至最大I'll max the signal,
把收发器变成引爆装置and the transceiver will act as a trigger.
好的Okay, fine.
我记得他们只生产了20块They only made 20, I think.
现在认为是这个人造成了爆炸事故吗So, we believe that this man is responsible for the blast?
斯凯说她认为他就是提交了报告的工人Skye said she thinks he's the worker who filed all the reports.
托拜厄斯·福特Tobias Ford.
应该是他It looks like him.
一个人既抱怨安全问题却又引发问题It makes no sense for a man to complain about safety issues
这说不通啊whilst causing them.
-另一个理论是...  -理论无所谓- Another theory is--  - Theory don't matter.
事实才要紧  事实就是Only facts, and the fact is,
子弹能让你离开任何一个世界a bullet will take you out of whatever world you're in.
知道梅可能带她去了哪个方向吗Any idea which direction May could've taken her?
我们用"金毛寻回犬"吧We'll deploy the Golden Retrievers.
在这里They're in here.
菲兹Fitz!
现在不是搞这种幼稚恶作剧的时候This is no time for childish nonsense like this!
恶作剧是你的主意Pranking was your idea.
而且很显然  这个完美的恶作剧And obviously, I rigged this little beauty
是在我听说空间穿越疯子前弄好的before I knew there was a dimension-jumping psychopath in the mix.
等等  幼稚Wait, childish.
这人孩子气This guy is childish.
你想说什么What are you getting at?
托拜厄斯Tobias.
是你吗Is that you?
他想引起她的注意He wanted her to notice him.
他为什么要在一切正常的情况下Why would he file a complaint to her office
向她办公室提交投诉when there was nothing wrong
然后自己制造真正的安全隐患and then cause an actual safety issue himself?
为了害她被炒鱿鱼吗To get her fired?
为了引起她的注意  与她共处To get her attention, to spend time with her.
想想看  他吓唬了那个Think about it -- he scared the guy
在加油站骚扰她的人who was harassing her at the airport.
他想用警车撞你He tried to hit you with a cop car.
因为我们要拘捕她When we took her into custody.
而且他并没企图伤害她Yeah, he's not trying to hurt her.
而是想保护她He's trying to protect her.
他喜欢她He likes her.
待在这里Stay here.
没事了It's okay.
没事了It's okay.
告诉他我不会伤害你Tell him I won't hurt you.
托拜厄斯  等等  她不是坏人Tobias, wait, she's a friend.
汉娜Hannah.
你得收手了You have to stop.
拜托了Please.
我们认为你被困在两个世界之间Listen, we believe you're trapped between two worlds --
-这个世界  -以及地狱- This world -- - And hell.
因为我做的事  我被困在了地狱I'm being dragged to hell for what I did.
你做了什么What did you do?
只是扭松了几颗螺栓  那样你就会来了Just loosen a few bolts, and then you'd visit.
那是我一天中最好的时光It was the best part of my day.
对不起  我无意伤害任何人I'm sorry. I-I didn't mean for anyone to get hurt.
不Oh, no.
托拜厄斯Tobias.
你怎么能这样How could you?
我杀了他们I killed them.
我知道I know.
更糟糕的是  大家开始责怪你And even worse, everyone started blaming you.
我想阻止他们I tr-- I tried to stop them.
但你伤害了更多的人But you hurt more people.
我是想保护你不被他们伤害I was trying to protect you from them.
我是想弥补罪过I was trying to atone for my sin.
汉娜  拜托Hannah, please,
也许你原谅我  我就不会下地狱了maybe if you forgive me, I won't go to hell.
只有上帝才能原谅你Only God can forgive you.
而他不会的And he won't.
做过的事没法挽回You can't undo what's been done.
它将永远伴着你That will be with you forever.
但想要留住这段人生But trying to hold on to this life,
不肯放弃你以为你可以做的那种人clinging to the person you thought you could be,
那才是地狱that's hell.
而你在拉她一起下地狱And you're dragging her down with you.
你必须放手You have to let go
不然我的同事来了也会逼你那么做before my people come and make you do it.
如果你关心她  我知道你关心If you care about her, and I know you do,
放过她let her go.
放过这姑娘  托拜厄斯Let the girl go, Tobias.
放下吧Let the girl go.
你没事吧Are you okay?
没事Yeah.
走吧  结束了Let's go, it's over.
你跟他说了什么What did you say to him?

她没事吧She all right?
好多了Much better.
她需要什么就告诉我Let me know if she needs anything.
-菲兹能修好吗  -不能- Can Fitz repair it? - No.
它没救了This one's a lost cause.
但梅还有救But May isn't.
如果有人能说服她  那就是你If anyone can bring her around, it's you.
你知道怎么激励别人[滴答作响]You know what makes people tick.
一语双关Pun intended.
你也是So do you.
你能看到人们的优点You see the good in them.
你善待汉娜You were a friend to Hannah,
等不及要了解梅you can't wait to get inside May's head,
你毫不费力就搞懂了托拜厄斯and you figured out Tobias without even trying.
看来我充满惊喜啊Guess I'm full of surprises.
但这并不是其中之一But this isn't one of them.
我让你密切留意I wanted you paying close attention

金属箍

-我没听说过  -我来查查- I've never heard of it. - I'm checking.
我们的语言Our language?
你是指发源于英国的英语吗You mean the English language, first spoken in England?
"金属箍  包住鞋带末端的塑料或金属管""Aglet -- a plastic or metal tube covering the end of a shoelace."
拜托Oh, come on.
她利用英国人的身份对付我们She used her Britishness against us.
