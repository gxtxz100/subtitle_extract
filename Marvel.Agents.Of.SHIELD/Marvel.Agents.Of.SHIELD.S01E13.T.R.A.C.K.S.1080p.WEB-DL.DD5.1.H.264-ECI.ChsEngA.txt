漫威《神盾局特工》前情回顾Previously on "Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."...
084代表...And an 0-8-4 is...?
来源不明的物体An object of unknown origin.
斯凯就是084吗Skye's the 0-8-4?
你为谁工作  蕾娜And who do you work for, Raina?
千里眼吗The Clairvoyant?
千里眼给了我们指导The Clairvoyant gives us guidance.
他让你制造超级战士He has you building super soldiers.
麦克是个好人Mike's a good guy.
麦克Mike!
早上好  彼得森先生
早上好  彼得森先生
等待进一步指示
不No.
伊恩·奎恩  你开玩笑吧Ian Quinn. You got to be kidding.
这就是奎恩的惯用手法This is Quinn's M.O.
他挖掘有才的年轻人并利用他们He finds young talent and he takes advantage.
我们盯上你了We're on to you.
多谢你了  科尔森特工Well, thank you, Agent Coulson.
我有件事也想敬告你And I have a message for you.
千里眼让我代他向你问好The Clairvoyant told me to say hello.
伊恩·奎恩Ian Quinn.
找到他了吗You found him?
没有  但我想我们有办法了No, but we think we know how we can.
斯凯追查到他一个空壳公司的发单Skye tracked down an invoice from one of his shell companies.
他最近进了一笔重要的货He made a big purchase recently.
-价值一千万美元  -知道是什么吗- $10 million big. - Any idea what it is?
不知道  但它是由赛博科技设计制造的No clue, but it was designed and built by Cybertek, inc.,
一家专做高科技研发的小公司a small firm that deals in advanced technology and research.
因此这笔交易才比较有趣Which is where this gets interesting.
他们雇了私人安保团队They've hired a private-security outfit
转移货物  退伍军人  前雇佣军to transport the purchase -- former military, ex-mercs.
为一个包裹这么兴师动众啊Lot of muscle to move one package.
而且他们知道神盾局盯上了奎恩And they know S.H.I.E.L.D's got eyes on Quinn.
所以他们选择了老运输方法Which is why they're transporting it old-school.
用火车  穿过意大利乡下On a train, through the Italian countryside,
从维罗那到萨格勒布  都是无人烟的地方From Verona to Zagreb -- very rural, very isolated.
你认为奎恩在火车上And you think Quinn's on that train.
不  但我认为他们会将货物交给奎恩本人No, but I believe they're delivering the item to Quinn himself.
我们从监控局势的意大利当局那里We got our intel from Italian authorities
得到了这个情报who have been monitoring the situation.
他们不介意我们接手吗And they don't mind us taking over the op?
我很客气地提出了请求I asked very nicely.
你这根本不是请求  科尔森特工You're not asking me at all, Agent Coulson.
你是让我和我的团队靠边站You're telling me and my team to step aside
把我们的调查交给你们神盾局to hand over our investigation to S.H.I.E.L.D.
别想成是交出来Try to think of it less as a hand-over
而是放手and more as a hand-off.
你们完成了任务  轮到我们了You've done your part. Now we'll do ours.
如果一切顺利If everything goes as planned,
赛博科技的安保根本不会知道我们上了火车Cybertek's security team won't even know we were on the train.
那就是要卧底行动了So we're going in undercover.
最讨厌卧底了I hate undercover.
梅和沃德  你们打头阵May and Ward, you're front and center.
找到包裹后  你们在上面安装追踪器Once we locate the package, you'll tag it with a tracker.
斯凯和菲兹  你们负责通讯Skye and Fitz, you'll be running communications.
装好追踪器  我们就能找到奎恩After the package is tagged, we'll follow it to Quinn.
抓到奎恩后Once we capture Quinn,
就离千里眼又近了一步we'll be one step closer to the Clairvoyant.
我们两个呢  长官And what about the two of us, sir?
我来吧Here. Let me get that.
谢谢  爸爸Oh. Thanks, dad.
看你的年纪  可不像有我这么大的女儿Who looks far too young to have a daughter my age.
头等车厢
从这儿过去就是  先生
要我带你们去包厢吗
那将是我的荣幸
我们自己找  谢谢
这女的挺难搞吧
至少不会无聊
穿得挺舒服啊That looks cozy.
等我找到包裹Once I've located the package,
就告诉你该把跟踪器放哪I'll let you know where to place the tracker.
觉不觉得要变成私人恩怨了Seem like things are getting personal?
我是指我们的行动I'm talking about our operations.
我知道科尔森受了很大折磨  但是...Look, I know Coulson was put through hell, but...
他跟以前不一样了he hasn't been the same since.
我不知道他对斯凯说了什么  但她也变了I don't know what he said to Skye, but she's different.
怎么变了How so?
更发奋  更专注了Driven, focused.
一躲好几天  想办法追踪奎恩And she was holed up for days trying to track down Quinn.
感觉科尔森让她进入战备状态了It feels like Coulson's got her on a warpath.
-感觉像是个人恩怨  -本来就是- Seems personal. - It is personal.
千里眼让人折磨他The Clairvoyant had him tortured.
奎恩是唯一已知跟这些事都有关的人Quinn's the only person we know who's connected to all this.
我们都清楚私人化的情绪We both know personal urges
会给战术决策带来负面影响can adversely affect tactical decisions.
所以我没有私人情绪Hmm. That's why I don't have any.
-你也该学学我  -真的吗- You should do the same. - Really?
你觉得科尔森发现我们的关系后会接受这个借口吗You think Coulson will take that excuse if he finds out about us?
我告诉他时他挺接受的啊Took it okay when I told him.
等等  你告诉他了吗Wait. You told him?
对Yep.
你紧张吗Are you nervous?
只想赶快完成任务Just ready for this all to be over.
我准备好抓住奎恩了I'm ready to get Quinn.
我也是Me, too.
那我们到底装英国人还是美国人So, are we British or American?
-有关系吗  -我们一起旅行- Does that matter? - Well, we're traveling together.
至少得是一个国家的人吧We should at least be from the same country.
你的苏格兰口音如何How's your Scottish accent?
不知道I don't know.
你说我讲的怎么样吧  兄弟You tell me how great it is, laddie.
还是装美国人吧American, then.
-那样好些  -那太好了- That's a better idea. - Oh. That was really good.
我是看着美剧长大的I used to watch a lot of American tv growing up.
有些挺不错  演员牙口都很好Some of it's quite good. Lots of nice teeth.
开始了  听我指挥Oh. Here we go. Follow my lead.
不好意思Excuse me.
-你会说英语吗  -当然- Do you speak English? - Of course.
有什么需要帮助的吗How may I be of service?
你能推荐一家萨格勒布市中心的好餐馆吗Can you recommend a restaurant in downtown Zagreb?
价格合理  分量要足Someplace affordable, with big portions.
想找浪漫的地方吗You are looking for something romantic?
是的  拜托Yes. Please.
我们在环欧洲旅行We are celebrating our six-month anniversary
庆祝我们恋爱半年with a whirlwind trip all over europe.
严格说  我们是半年前认识的Well, technically, we met six months ago,
但直到上个月他才约我出去but he didn't ask me out till last month,
所以正式的满月纪念是下周六so our official one-month anniversary isn't until next saturday.
-周日  周六  -嗯- Sunday --  saturday. - Yeah.
我觉得他有点怕我I think he found me intimidating.
年轻的爱  真是...令人费解Young love. So...confusing.
是吗Is it?
你刚才可是有点慌啊You, uh, got a little flustered back there.
什么What?
你像我奶奶一样亲我脸的时候吗When you kissed me on the cheek like my grandmother?
真是高招  完全令人信服Good going. Really selling our relationship there.
我有个能做这种事的设备I have a device that could have done those things --
撬锁什么的broken the lock and all that.
什么  你之前怎么没说What? Why wouldn't you tell me that?
我总是拿些小道具I'm always the gadget guy.
或许我有时候就想亲自动手呢Maybe sometimes I want to do things with my bare hands.
可这些小道具也是你亲手做的啊You make the gadgets with your bare hands.
就让我自怨自艾下吧  好吗Just allow me these rare moments of self-pity, okay?
你真是我交过的最不配合的假女友了You're the least supportive pretend girlfriend I've ever had.
通讯器接通了Comms are live.
科尔森  西蒙斯  都就位了吗Coulson, Simmons, you in position?
是的  就等梅发信号了Yes. Just waiting on may's signal.
记住  我们的目标是卡罗So remember, our target is Carlo --
曼西尼  安全主管 Mancini, the head of security.
我知道  我记得他的长相I know. I memorized his face.
我记得所有事I memorized everything.
你在做什么What are you doing?
我在进入角色I'm getting into character.
我的卧底身份对她不称职的美国父亲My undercover persona harbors residual resentment
一直心存不满to her absent American father --
埋怨他在母亲去世时没陪在她身边blames him for not being there when her mom died.
所以我可能会比较冷淡  先给你提个醒So I apologize in advance if I come off a little cold.
这么多背景故事有必要吗You think all that back story's necessary?
以往的经历  例如中心那次不幸事件Past events, like that unfortunate incident at the hub,
充分说明了我不擅长即兴发挥have shown me that I'm not good at improvisation.
但是  我十分善于做准备However, I excel at preparation.
他正在朝你们过去He's headed your way.
到你上场了You're on.
妈妈只希望你爱她All mom ever wanted was your love,
与你相守to be with you,
在我们科茨沃尔德的双层维多利亚风格的家里at our two-story victorian home in the Cotswolds.
但你有给过她一点关心吗But could you even give her a moment,
你那该死的银行工作what with your banking job requiring you
要你每隔一周就去美国出差  从周二待到周六to travel to the states from Tuesday to Saturday every other week?!
没有No!
↙斯坦·李
对你痛失至亲我深表遗憾  亲爱的I'm terribly sorry about your loss, dear.
至于你  是时候好好补偿她了As for you, now is your chance to do better.
你最好把握住这个机会Why don't you see that you take it?
谢谢您  先生Thank you, sir.
我们走吧Let's go.
他说得对He's right.
你从没有时间关心她You never had any time for her,
却有时间忙你的工作but you made time for your work!
跟妓女们鬼混And your prostitutes!
-天哪  -不  妈妈- Oh, god! - Oh! Oh, no! Mom!
我很抱歉[意大利语]Mi dispiace.
真的非常抱歉Terribly sorry.
还妓女们  一个还不够吗Prostitutes? Plural?
梅  目标朝你那边去了May, coming your way.

正跟踪目标前往包裹的位置Following the target to the package.
很好Great.
我们收到你传送来的图像了We see what you see.
好了  梅  赛博科技的箱子通常内衬All right, May, Cybertek cases are usually lined
钨聚合物以防扫描with tungsten polymer to prevent scanning.
所以用你的红外线仪看应该是黑色的It should appear black on your infrared.
看到包裹了  从后面数第四个座位Bingo! Uh, eyes on the package, fourth seat from the back.
各位先生女士  你们好Scusi ben signore e signori.
列车转弯后As we round the bend,
车窗朝北的乘客the passengers on the north side of the train
将能看到著名的拉瓦莱多三大峰can take in the views of the famous Tre Cime di Lavaredo.
是不是很壮观呢Isn't it a wonder?
看啊Look at that.
自从上次全家一起I haven't seen anything so beautiful
去泰国东南部龟岛潜水后since our family's scuba-diving trip
我就没见过这么美的景色了to the island of Koh Tao in southeastern Thailand.
西蒙斯  你的准备非常细致  但...Okay, Simmons, I appreciate all your preparation, but --
你不问问我们看到了哪些海洋生物吗And you want to know which marine life we encountered?
沃德  你是否就位Ward, are you in position?
我的通讯器坏了  你的还能用吗My comms are down. Are yours working?
菲兹  斯凯Fitz? Skye?
事情不对劲  待在这儿Something's wrong. Sit tight.
我去确认一下包裹是否还在I'm gonna go make sure we don't lose that package.
-沃德  -我们暴露了- Ward! - We've been made!
手榴弹  科尔森  我们得跳车Grenade! Coulson, we got to jump!
各位先生女士  你们好Scusi ben signore e signori.
列车转弯后As we round the bend,
车窗朝北的乘客the passengers on the north side of the train
将能看到著名的拉瓦莱多三大峰can take in the views of the famous Tre Cime di Lavaredo.
是否令人惊叹呢Isn't it a wonder?
梅  追踪器在我这里May, got the tracker.
我这就去餐车把它放在包裹上Headed to the dining car now to tag the package.
梅May?
梅May?
不好意思  乘务员先生
你能帮我提一下这件行李吗
很抱歉  小姐  我还有事要忙
我会让别人来协助您的
就耽误你一会儿  这行李真的很重
好吧  小姐
赛博科技的人知道我们在火车上Cybertek knew we were here.
有人收到吗Anyone copy?
糟了Damn it.
我们暴露了We've been made.
通讯都中断了  科尔森呢Comms are down. Where's Coulson?
他去餐车那边找包裹了He went to the dining car to find the package.
你受伤了  我帮你看看You've been hurt. Let me take a look.
先别看了  你快去行李车Not now. Go to the luggage car.
跟菲兹和斯凯把门锁好Lock yourself in with Fitz and Skye.
我去找你们再出来  我先去找科尔森Don't come out until I get you. I'm gonna get Coulson.
-沃德  -我们暴露了- Ward! - We've been made!
手榴弹  科尔森  我们得跳车Grenade! Coulson, we got to jump!
火车  怎么...The train -- it just...
对  消失了Yep. Vanished.
这可...不是易事啊Which, I might add... not easy.
我还跟西蒙斯说会回去找他们I told Simmons I'd come back for them.
梅在上面  不会有事的May's there. They'll be okay.
不  她也不在上面No, she's not.
你的手机还能用吗Is your phone working?
不能No.
一定是赛博科技的人把电子设备弄失灵了Cybertek must have taken out our electronics.
这并不是个手榴弹Not a grenade, exactly.
可能是种隐形装置Might be some kind of cloaking mechanism.
或许是创造了个传送门Maybe it created some kind of portal,
把火车送进那里面了jumped the train there?
希望不是  我今天可没工夫对付阿斯加德Oh, let's hope not. I can't deal with Asgard today.
赛博科技的人知道我们要来Cybertek knew we were coming.
怎么知道的How?
可能是千里眼搞的鬼Could have been the clairvoyant.
我们得回飞机上  快走We got to get back to the plane. Come on.
车上可能有钥匙  这里是乡下Keys might be in it. It's the country.
乡下人没那么大的戒心People are very trusting in the country.
车已经启动了It's running.
是热线发动的Yeah, it's been hot-wired.
-这...  -很可疑吗- This is... - Suspicious?
我是想说真幸运  快走吧I was gonna say "Fortuitous." Let's get out of here.
鲁索先生  你没事吧Signore Russo, are you okay?
科尔森特工  谢天谢地Agent Coulson. Thank God.
我一直联系你来着  赛博科技的人知道了I've been trying to reach you. Cybertek knew.
他们知道我们去车站了They knew we were at the station.
他们也知道我们上了火车They knew we were on the train, too.
我们大多队友还下落不明Most of my team is unaccounted for.
我大多手下都死了Most of my men are dead!
-你现在在哪里  -在我们的飞机上- Where are you now? - On our plane.
我们把坐标发给你We'll send you the coordinates.
对了  鲁索  你知道那列火车哪去了吗And, Russo, do you have any idea what happened to the train?
这话什么意思What do you mean?
火车消失了  可我的人还在车上It vanished, with our team still on it.
知道了  我们马上着手调查Okay. We'll look into that.
我这就去找你I'm on my way to you now.
我们联手或许能弄明白到底是怎么回事And maybe together, we can find some answers, yes?
现在怎么办What now?
我联系总部  你拿着这个I'll call H.Q. You take this.
我们得弄明白火车到底哪去了We need to figure out what the hell happened to that train.
全息桌面  开启Holotable -- on.
全息桌面  启动Holotable -- activate.
搞什么Really?
神盾局调出卫星图像了S.H.I.E.L.D. pulled satellite images.
-然后呢  -火车不见了- And? - Train's gone.
他们正在查别的行车路线They're checking alternate routes.
只要火车还在地球上  我们就能找到If it's somewhere on earth, we'll find it.
这个...不太好操作  对吧It's...pretty tricky, right?
我估计连启动按钮都找不到I couldn't even find the "On" button.
你会拉近放大吗Can you zoom in?
菲兹-西蒙斯好像是这样操作的...I -- I think Fitz-Simmons do something more like...
该死Damn.
还是直接把参数上传给总部吧Let's just upload the specs to H.Q.
-好主意  -是啊- Good idea. - Yeah.
对了  长官Oh. Uh, sir?
现在时机可能不太对This probably isn't the best time,
但梅告诉你的事But what May told you...
我本希望这事天知地知  梅知我知I would have preferred it to stay between me and her.
"这事"发生在我的空客上Well, "it" is happening on my bus,
发生在我的队友之间amongst members of my team.
不  我们没...做过...No, we've never...done --
没在空客上做过  长官it's never happened on the bus, sir.
你非要现在说这个吗  那好You want to do this now? Okay.
你的所作所为是违反规定的What you're doing is against protocol,
所以如果你威胁到行动或是有人受伤so if you endanger an operation or if anyone gets hurt,
我就把你调到阿拉斯加的巴罗去I'll reassign you to Barrow, Alaska,
让你后半辈子and you'll spend the rest of your years
都值夜班看守布朗斯基的冷冻细胞pulling the night shift guarding Blonsky's cryo-cell.

我说明白了吗Am I clear?
我就当你默认了I'll take that as a yes.
如果真的只跟性有关  沃德And if it's really just sex, Ward...

他们也会好好照顾你的And they'll take care of you, too.
只要你告诉我All you have to do is tell me
科尔森特工和沃德特工在哪where Agent Coulson and Ward are.
就这样That's it.
你笑什么Why are you smiling?
你叫我"亲爱的"You called me "sweetheart."
好吧  用你的方式来Fine. Have it your way.
记住  是你上司主动要求参与这次行动Just remember, your boss asked to be part of this op.
我还警告过他I warned him against it.
如果你要怪什么人的话  就怪他吧So if you're looking for someone to blame, look to him.
这正是我想要的That's just what I needed.
鲁索Russo!
如果真的只跟性有关  沃德If it's really just sex, Ward...
你应该习惯说出来You should get more comfortable using the word.
科尔森特工  没事了Agent Coulson, it's going to be all right.
我们找到了你的人We found your people.
火车...The train, it's --
五分钟后起飞Wheels up in five.
你没事吧You okay?
火车消失时你还在上面You were on the train when it disappeared.
梅  鲁索是...May, Russo was --
解释一下  拜托Explain yourself, please.
火车没有消失  鲁索出卖了我们The train didn't disappear. Russo sold us out.
做好起飞准备  我要冲个澡Get the plane ready. I need a shower.
你受伤了  我帮你缝合一下吧You're hurt. Let me stitch you up.
我说了做好起飞准备I said get the plane ready.
我来帮你吧Let me help.
要知道You know...
我们准备这些东西是有原因的We have this stuff for a reason.
神盾局找到了那列火车S.H.I.E.L.D. found the train.
我们下车后不久  它切换了轨道Turns out it switched tracks shortly after we got off.
手榴弹肯定释放了某种毒素That grenade must have released some kind of toxin.
让我们以为时间没有流逝Made us believe no time had passed.
我看到你们躺在地上  一动不动I saw you guys frozen on the field.
你的样子很可笑You looked ridiculous.
原计划不是战斗行动It wasn't supposed to be a combat op.
他们不会有事的  能应对得来They'll be fine. They can handle themselves.
我按住了  轻点  好了I got it. Gently. Okay.
谢了Thank you.
其它地方受伤了吗Did he get you anywhere else?
飞机得变更航向We need to reroute the plane.
神盾局传来消息We just got word from S.H.I.E.L.D.
火车突然在意大利乡下停下that the train stopped suddenly in the Italian countryside.
什么  为什么What? Why?
很快就会知道了  我去设置坐标We'll find out soon. I'll set the coordinates.
十分钟后着陆Touchdown in 10.
我来帮忙I'll come help.
我可以的I got it.
谢谢Grazie.
15分钟前停在了这儿Parked here 15 minutes ago.
地勤特工也不知道为什么Agents on the ground have no idea why.
找到菲兹-西蒙斯和斯凯了吗Any sign of Fitz-Simmons and Skye?
没有No.
大家趴下Everyone get down!
西蒙斯  住手Simmons, stop!
怎么回事What?
菲兹和斯凯在哪Where are Fitz and Skye?
各位先生女士  你们好Scusi ben signore e signori.
列车转弯后As we round the bend,
车窗朝北的乘客...passengers on the north side of the train...
真希望我们有时间欣赏美景I wish we had more time to take in the scenery.
...将能看到著名的拉瓦莱多三大峰...can take in the views of the famous tre cime di lavaredo.
拉瓦莱多三大峰  据说很美Three peaks of lavaredo -- supposed to be stunning.
里面可能会是084吗Any chance what's in there could be an 0-8-4?
这个吗  我们虽不知道里头是什么This? Now, we may not know what it is,
但我们知道它来自赛博科技but we do know that it came from Cybertek.
没错  来源不明Right. Unknown origin.
我们在秘鲁找到的是台机器And the one we found in Peru was a machine,
但也不总是机器  是吧but they don't always have to be, right?
对  我读到过各种084No. No, I've read about all kinds --
武器  宇宙飞船  能源weapons, spacecraft, energy sources.
我想它们唯一的共同特征I suppose the only thing they really do have in common
就是它们都很危险is that they're dangerous.
好吧Right.
不管这包裹究竟是什么Hey, whatever this package turns out to be,
都会有办法处理的  一向如此we'll deal with it, like we always do.
更糟的情况我们都撑下来了We've faced worse and made it through.
菲兹  你听说过084是个人的吗Fitz, have you ever heard of an 0-8-4 being a person?
没  但这大概也有可能吧No. Although I -- I suppose it's possible.
我可不想跟他打交道Hate to meet the guy.
梅的护目镜没信号了  什么时候掉线的May's goggles are offline. When did that happen?
梅  听得到我说话吗May, do you copy?
所有通讯器和手机都没信号了All comms and phones are dead.
有人在用电子干扰器之类的东西Someone's using some sort of electronic scrambler.
赛博科技知道我们在这儿Cybertek knows we're here.
我们得去提醒队友We have to warn our team.
菲兹  趴下Fitz, get down!
我们暴露了We've been made!
我的天呐Oh, bloody hell.
珍玛Jemma!
天哪Oh, my god.
她没事She's okay.
好  把她抱起来Okay. Hold her up.
就这样There we go.
这好像是树眼镜蛇毒素I think this is some form of dendrotoxin.
和"好梦"枪里一样的东西吗The same stuff that's in the night-night gun?
对  但这显然是升级版Yeah. It's clearly evolved.
给做成空气传播的了I think they made it airborne.
所以他们的眼睛才是睁着的吗Is that why their eyes are open?
他们应该是进入了深度休眠I suppose if they were in some sort of black sleep,
这就说得通了that would make sense.
我们得赶快离开We got to get out of here,
找到其他人  想想接下来怎么办Find the others and figure out what to do next.
好  先帮我把西蒙斯搬走Yeah, but help me move Simmons first.
不能就这么把她留在这儿Can't just leave her like this.
看她的小脸  她会觉得丢人的Look at her little face. She'd be so embarrassed.
以防万一  我们该给她留个防身的东西We should leave her with something to protect herself, just in case.
嗯  有把备用的Yeah. Have a spare.
那他呢What about him?
这是为了西蒙斯That's for Simmons.
火车停下了Train's stopped.
我知道  而且我找遍了列车I know. And I looked everywhere.
梅  沃德和科尔森都不见了May, Ward, and Coulson are gone.
赛博科技的人呢What about Cybertek?
他们拿着包裹  菲兹They have the package, Fitz.
只剩下我们了  怎么办What do we do? We're the only ones left.
你有多余的追踪器吗Do you have an extra tracker?
有啊Of course.
那我们就跟上他们Then we follow them.
科尔森是对的Coulson was right.
赛博科技让我们找到了奎恩Cybertek led us to quinn.
激活追踪器  Activate the tracker.
让他们知道我们在这儿Let them know we're here.
你想进去You want to go in.
不能让奎恩再逃了We can't let Quinn get away again.
如果科尔森在  他也不会让他逃掉的If Coulson were here, he wouldn't let that happen.
他也不会希望我们任之不管He wouldn't want us to let that happen.
你说得对You're right.
行动吧Let's do it.
你能让他们的汽车瘫痪吗Can you disable their cars?
靠两只手就行With my bare hands.
拿着这个Take this.
你在这儿还用得着呢You'll need it out here.
拿着吧Just take it.
要小心  好吗Be careful, okay?
你也是You, too.
好吧Okay.
找到奎恩先生Find Mr. Quinn.
告诉他  他买的东西在楼下Tell him his purchase is downstairs.
-麦克  -你好- Mike. - Hello.
斯凯Skye.
千里眼告诉我你会来The Clairvoyant told me to expect you.
奎恩先生Signor Quinn,
