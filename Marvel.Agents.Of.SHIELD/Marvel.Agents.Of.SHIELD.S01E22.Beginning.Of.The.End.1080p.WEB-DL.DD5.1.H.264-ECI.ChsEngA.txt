漫威《神盾局特工》前情回顾Previously on "Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."...
九头蛇的事我们本该料到We should have seen Hydra coming.
但他们已经大势已去But they don't stand a chance.
约翰·加勒特还没完蛋John Garrett does.
如果你要在神盾局内部为九头蛇工作If you're gonna work within S.H.I.E.L.D. for Hydra,
就不能对他们产生感情you can't ever get attached.
我知道你在乎我们  沃德I know that you care about us, Ward!
你说得对  我的确在乎You're right. I do.
-沃德  -沃德- Ward! - Ward!
这是弱点It's a weakness.
你还是麦克·彼得森  想想你儿子You're still Mike Peterson. You have a son.
-咱爷俩  我们是什么  -一个团队- You and me -- what are we? - We're a team.
那么也有人能看到的你看到的一切吗So, is someone seeing everything you see?
我能不能去看我儿子
还不行
如果你不听话Waiting to push a button
就按下按钮把你脑袋炸个洞and blow a hole in your skull if you disobey?
加勒特不仅是想给他的蜈蚣战士弄到GH325Garrett doesn't just want GH-325 for his centipede soldiers.
他自己也想要He wants it for himself.
你感觉到什么了What are you feeling?
宇宙The universe.
斯凯给他们留了小惊喜Skye left them a little surprise.
特洛伊病毒A trojan horse.
在慢慢探查他们上传了硬盘资料的每个系统It's been slowly mapping every system they've uploaded it to.
如果那理发店里有计算机系统If there's a computer system in that barber shop,
我们就不用再追他了we don't have to chase him anymore.
抱歉要过这么多安检程序Sorry about the security red tape --
知识产权什么的嘛You know, intellectual property, blah, blah, blah.
你会习惯的You'll get used to it.
我从公司一成立就在这儿了So, basically, I've been here since day one.
一开始在地下室里  只有我和一台电脑It started with me on my computer in a basement,
瞧瞧我们现在的规模and now look what we've grown into.
如今我们有20个在线系统  还在飞速增长We've got 20 active systems, and we're growing fast.
我能问问旁边的建设是怎么回事吗I was gonna ask about the construction next door.
那个嘛  我们准备在月底之前Ah, yeah, we're planning to add another 100 systems
再增加一百个系统by the end of the month.
那是莎莉That's Sally.
你好啊  莎莉Hey, Sally.
那么  你就是对这些感兴趣吗So, what -- are you just really into this sort of thing,
你为什么想来我们公司or what brings you to the company?
因为激励计划Um... the incentives program?
是啊Yeah.
至今还没有人能拒绝它呢No one's turned that down yet.
总之  每个操作员掌管一个单元Anyway, so, every operator is in charge of one unit.
你会在上线24小时前收到一封电邮You will receive an e-mail 24 hours before it goes online.
他们中有些是志愿前来Now, some are volunteers,
也有一些跟你情况相同but some are here for the same reason that you're here --
泽勒Hey, Zeller.
我们已经就位We're in position.
好的Okay.
第一天能学到这个也是好事This is good for you to learn on your first day.
发生什么了What's going on?
看到这些人了吗These guys?
我们不喜欢他们We don't like these guys.
是的  长官  我们已经看到了他们Yes, sir, we have them in sight.
明白Copy that.
好了  大家伙Okay, people...
赛博科技
给他们点颜色瞧瞧吧...let 'em have it.
这里要是有点亮就好了Could sure use a little light in here.
交给我I got this.
要理发的话该找谁So, who do we talk to about getting a haircut?
这不是大名鼎鼎的"铁骑"吗If it isn't the Cavalry.
别这么叫我Don't ever call me that.
大展身手吧[拆掉房子]Bring the house down.
该走了Time to go!
快走  快走Let's go. Let's go.
我们的人还没从下面出来Our men are still digging themselves out,
但看来科尔森和其他人逃脱了but it looks like Coulson and the others got away.
你要...Do you want to --
无所谓了Doesn't matter.
你还好吗You all right?
你觉得呢What does it look like?
不能再好了  孩子Never better, son.
我需要个钉子I need a nail.
给我找个钉子来  大点的Get me a nail -- a big one!
他这是在干什么What the hell is he doing?
他在适应他的新身体He's flexing his new muscles.
如今我们所有的研究成果He has every ounce of our research
都流淌在他的血管中coursing through his veins.
他感觉一定不错He feels good.
那当然  我们的神药都被他用了Because he took all of our miracle drug.
等我们到了赛博科技When we land at Cybertek,
军队高层和投资者还等着我们展示成果military brass and investors are expecting a demonstration,
我当初承诺的是无坚不摧的超级战士and I promised them indestructible super soldiers,
可不是一次性战士not disposable ones.
如今有了九头蛇  我们会有数不尽的志愿者Well, with Hydra in the mix, we won't lack for volunteers.
如果还不够And if we run out,
可以利用激励计划招募新人our incentives program should help fill the ranks.
我得把这些想法写下来Just getting some ideas down.
我的脑子都快装不下了I can't keep everything in my head.
我得跟你说实话  约翰Got to be honest with you, John --
你看起来像是疯了looks like you're kind of losing it.
多亏了你  我才得以重生I'm alive for the first time, thanks to you.
虽然途中受到一些挫折  但我们做到了We took some hits along the way, but we did it.
我们成功了We did it.
真不敢相信Can't believe it.
这就是我们一直以来的目标This is everything we've been working towards --
为了救你saving you.
与九头蛇结盟只是达成这一目的的手段  对吗Our alliance with hydra was always a means to that end, right?
互利共生Symbiotic.
现在达到目的了啊And here we are.
反正我们也不是真正的信徒  不是吗I mean, it's not like we're true believers, right?
别误会Don't get me wrong.
你去哪里我都会跟随I'll go where you go.
关键位置有了自己人确实不错Having our soldiers in key positions is great,
但是然后呢but...then what?
我们真要搞什么政变吗Are we really planning a coup?
应该说是崛起It's more of an uprising.
比九头蛇规模还要大It's become bigger than hydra.
沃德  你把我照顾得很好Ward, you've taken good care of me,
给了我想要的一切gave me everything I wanted.
现在你该想想你想要什么了It's time for you to decide what it you want.
我会确保你也能如愿  孩子I'll see that you get it, too, son.
我现在能做任何事I can do anything now.
木马程序生效了The trojan horse worked.
我们可以访问所需的系统It gave us access to the system we wanted.
我们的秘密武器Our secret weapon --
我们现在能掌握他们所有的动态了we now have eyes on their operation right in the palm of my hand.
想打败加勒特只有动态可不够We'll need more than eyes to defeat Garrett.
怎么了What is it?
菲兹-西蒙斯的追踪器跨过了大洋Fitz-Simmons' tracker crossed the ocean.
现在在新墨西哥It's in New Mexico.
他们成功追踪了飞机吗They managed to tag the plane?
看来是的  但他们不回复呼叫It appears so, but they're not answering.
不No.
我们现在没法考虑那么多We can't think about that right now.
他们有可能被抓了They may have been captured.
不管怎样  他们不惜一切代价Either way, they risked everything
为我们在飞机上装了一个追踪器to put a tracker on that plane for us.
我们现在知道加勒特在哪了Now we know exactly where Garrett is,
斯凯也能监控他们的行动了and Skye can see what he's doing.
如果菲兹和西蒙斯还活着If Fitz and Simmons are still alive,
那么抓住加勒特就是找到他们的唯一办法then catching Garrett is our only shot at finding them.
你睡得很安详You looked very peaceful sleeping.
不想吵醒你  但很高兴你醒了Didn't want to wake you, but I'm glad that you're up.
发生了什么What's happening?
我花了一小时琢磨我们为什么沉底了I've spent the last hour trying to figure out why we sank.
我们在海底We're at the bottom of the ocean,
如果你没发现的话in case you missed that bit.
舱体被建造为能与These pods are built to be compatible
所有神盾局飞机  潜艇和飞船兼容with all S.H.I.E.L.D. aircraft, submarines, spacecraft.
遇到冲击时  大气适应系统On impact, the atmospheric adaptation
一定是想抵消冲击must have tried to compensate.
随着外墙密度不断增加  我们就沉底了We slowly sank as it increased the density of the outer walls.
我测量了窗外水面上升的速度I measured the rate the water rose on the glass.
计算了一下  我们至少在90尺深水底Did the math -- we're at least 90 feet down.
看不到水面You can't see the surface.
我们怎么会没摔死啊How did we survive the fall?
飞机当时肯定处于低空垂直飞行The plane must have been in vertical flight mode, flying low.
撞击前  我把我们绑在了一面背板上I managed to strap us to one of the backboards before we hit.
我的胳膊断了And I broke my arm --
跟我二年级时断的两个地方一模一样  真奇怪same two places I broke it in second grade...which is strange.
我以为我们死定了呢  菲兹I thought we were dead for sure, Fitz.
我们太幸运了We're so lucky.
现在我们只需要想办法逃出去就行了Now we just need to figure a way out of here.
我们会想到办法逃出去的  对吧We'll find a way out of here, right?
然后我们就会在一片汪洋之中了And then we'd be in the middle of the ocean
出现减压病症状  没浮力  也没搜救人员with the bends and no floatation and no one looking for us.
我已经花了一小时试图利用心电图的I already spent an hour trying to rig the wireless signals
无线信号发出微弱的求救信号on the EKG to send out a weak distress call
后来想到那是个神盾局频率before remembering that it's a S.H.I.E.L.D. frequency
没人会听到的and no one's listening.
问题还不在这里  问题是And that's not the problem -- the problem is
这里的补给不多了that there aren't many supplies left in here,
所以我又算了一下so I've already done the math --
别再算了  你到底什么意思Enough with the math. What are you saying?
我们出不去了There is no way out.
我们会死在这里We're going to die down here.
我们只有一次机会We only get one shot at this,
所以再过一遍计划吧so let's go over the plan one more time
确保我们知道自己要做什么to make sure we're clear on exactly what we're doing, okay?
崔普和我降落在山顶Trip and I will crest the ridge,
用噪音制造器抢个三轮摩托use a noisemaker to grab a three-wheel,
最好是装有枪炮的maybe something with more fireworks,
给你们打开一扇窗户and open a window for you two.
你们爬进去  抓住负责人  逼他行动You crawl in, grab the dealer, force his hand.
他会带我们拿到杀手锏  然后就大功告成了He'll get us our ace in the hole, and then bob's your uncle.
明白了Roger that.
听起来很容易Makes it sound easy.
科尔森  这个计划很可行Coulson, it's a solid plan you've mapped out,
但都基于一个很大的赌博but it hinges on a gamble -- a big one.
而且没有后援And backup isn't coming.
只有我们四个It'll be just the four of us.
人数和火力我们都处于弱势We'll be outmanned and outgunned.
但弗瑞总是说But fury always said...
当人明白自己在参与...a man can accomplish anything
一项伟大的事业  便能无往不利when he realizes he's a part of something bigger.
拥有如此信念的队伍可以改变世界A team of people who share that conviction can change the world.
所以怎么样So, what do you say?
准备好改变世界了吗You ready to change the world?
没有No.
但我准备好大战一场了I'm ready to kick some ass.
那也行That works, too.
我只是想让你跟他谈谈I'm saying, just talk to him.
他说一切都好  但他的行为不像很好He says everything's fine, but he's not acting that way.
我不知道他怎么了  但我不喜欢他这样子I don't know what's going on with him, and I don't like it.
真迷人  是不是Captivating, isn't it?
我第一次看见它的时候  联想到了熔岩灯First time I saw it, it reminded me of a lava lamp.
当然  那时我还不能看透它Of course, that was before I could see through it.
奎恩想得到重力鎓作为回报Quinn's expecting the gravitonium as payment.
等他完事之后  还是给他比较明智When he's done, I think it would be wise to let him have it.
别拐弯抹角了Don't be coy.
我知道你对这东西另有打算I know you have plans for the stuff.
现在我理解了  我能看透它了I understand it now. I can see its soul.
我也能看透你I can see yours, too.
沃德很担心你的神智Ward's concerned you're going mad.
药物不仅仅强化了我的身体The drug didn't just strengthen my body,
也让我心如明镜it gave me clarity of mind.
它让我看到了这个世界下It gave me a vision of the world
等着破壳而出的新世界that's waiting beneath the surface of this world.
你并不觉得这是疯话  是吧You don't think that's mad, do you?
你很清楚我在说什么You know exactly what I'm talking about.
你一直很清楚You always have.
我不效忠于九头蛇I have no allegiance to Hydra,
蜈蚣组织或是赛博科技  或是你Centipede, Cybertek...you.
我唯一感兴趣的就是I was only ever interested in --
进化Evolution.
你知道我们就是史前生物You know we're prehistoric creatures
缓慢地爬出泥潭  穿过浓雾oozing out of the swamps, through the mist,
挣扎着登上陆地  以求能站起来clawing our way onto land so we can finally stand
或者深深扎根  或者飞上天空or plant roots... or fly.
没错Exactly.
知道你并非真正的千里眼时我很失望I was saddened to learn you weren't Clairvoyant.
有个问题我之前没能问  但现在I had a question I didn't get to ask, but now...
现在所有的真相都尽收眼底Now the truth is written on the back of my eyes,
所以so...
别犹豫  花裙妹go ahead, flowers.
尽管问Ask.
我会变成什么What will I become?
你害怕吗Are you scared?
当然Yeah.
我还饿了And I'm hungry, too.
我也是Me too.
又怕又饿Scared and hungry.
你觉得那会是什么感觉What do you think it's like?
死去吗Death?
这取决于死法Well, depends on the method, really.
据说淹死到后来其实不那么难受Drowning's supposed to be quite pleasant in the end, apparently.
等肺里灌满了水...Once the water fills up your lungs --
我是说死后I mean after.
这个啊Ah, yeah. Well.
我妈老是对我说  你不用害怕死亡my mum always said that you shouldn't be afraid
因为那就像你出生之前的状态because it's just like the way life was before you were born...
说起来也没那么可怕  是不是Which wasn't that bad, was it?
真贴心That's sweet...
不过我出生前也挺不好过的Though, apparently, I was miserable before I was born.
大头朝下  脑袋缠着脐带Upside down, umbilical cord all wrapped around my head.
她说的是受孕之前的...Yeah, well, she meant pre-conception of cour--
我知道  我开玩笑呢I know. I'm joking.
我当然知道你在开玩笑Yeah, I know that you're joking. That's fine.
我总想到热力学第一定律I like to think about the first law of thermodynamics,
宇宙中的能量不会被制造出来that no energy in the universe is created...
-也不会被消灭  -也不会被消灭- none is destroyed. - None is destroyed.
这意味着我们体内蕴含的所有能量That means that every bit of energy inside us,
每一个粒子every particle
都会成为别的事物的一部分will go on to be a part of something else,
也许是海蛾鱼  也许是微生物maybe live as a dragonfish, a microbe,
也许会在百亿年后在超新星中燃烧maybe burn in a supernova 10 billion years from now.
而现在构成我们身体的每个粒子And every part of us now
都曾是别的事物的一分子was once a part of some other thing --
可能来自月亮  积雨云  或者猛犸A moon, a storm cloud, a mammoth.
或者是猴子A monkey.
或者是猴子A monkey.
成千上万的美丽生物Thousands and thousands of other beautiful things
就像我们一样惧怕死亡that were just as terrified to die as we are.
我们赋予他们新生We gave them new life --
希望是快乐的一生a good one, I hope.
我们沉在这里还挺合适  菲兹It's fitting we're down here together, Fitz.
这里本来就是地球上所有生命的源头This is where all life began on our planet, anyway...
-就在这玻璃之外  -珍玛- Just outside that glass. - Jemma.
怎么了What?
玻璃The glass.
菲兹  这玻璃Fitz, the glass.
怎么了Yeah.
防弹  抗压玻璃It's bulletproof, pressure-resistant.
但是封胶里肯定含有二丙酮醇But the seal is 4-hydroxy-4-methyl-2-pentanone, surely.
我知道你在想什么Yeah, I know what you're thinking,
但这种物质燃点太高了but the flash point is too high for it to burn.
但医用乙醇燃点很低  而且燃烧起来会But medical ethanol has a low flash point, and it burns --
产生高温Hotter.
如果我们用除颤器作引火源If we could use the defibrillator as an ignition source...
做出一种压缩爆炸物...And build a compressed explosive...
来引燃封胶  窗外的水压To ignite the seal, the outside pressure will...
就会向内击破玻璃Blow the window in!
太好了  太好了Yes, yes, yes, yes!
-可疼死我啦  -好吧- This really hurts my arm. - Okay.
搞清楚这个之后Well, now we know that,
我们就要面对新的问题了  从哪开始there's a whole new set of problems, but where do we start?
赛博科技制造基地
最后  欢迎来到控制区And finally, welcome to our cybernetics subsection,

别紧张Relax.
这只是演习  基地很安全Practice drills. The compound's secure.
你们不用担心You have nothing to worry about.
告诉我们外面到底发生了什么Tell us what the hell is going on out there,
不然你就跟政府合同说再见吧or you can kiss a government contract goodbye.

你又不是狗You're not a rottweiler.
我们不需要他们的残羹冷饭We don't need their scraps.
这人是谁Who the hell is this?
这是我们的战略顾问  约翰·加勒特This is our strategy consultant, John Garrett.
立刻把详情都告诉我I want full disclosure right now,
否则我就派人来把你们关掉or our boys will come in and shut you down.
为什么会有枪声Why do I hear gunfire?
那是旧世界的最后一口气  将军You hear the dying breath of an old world, general,
新世界正在到来and a new world is coming.
我已经能尝到了I've tasted it on my tongue.
这是你的战略顾问吗This is your strategy consultant?
他是兼职的He's...part time.
新战略如下  你闭上嘴New strategy -- you shut your mouth
把我们要的都给我们and give us everything we want.
你竟敢威胁一位美国将军You threaten a United States general,

你哪都不许去You're not going anywhere.
你以为你能偷走重力鎓吗You think you can steal the gravitonium?
这是给我们的It was given to us.
你到底跟加勒特说了什么What the hell did you say to Garrett?
我认真倾听了I listened.
他疯了  你注意到了吗He's psychotic. Did you notice that?
我刚刚不得不关押了六名政府官员I just had to lock up six government officials
因为他残杀了第七个because he butchered the seventh one.
他已经完全丧失理智了He completely lost it in there.
你错了  加勒特没有丧失理智You're wrong. Garrett's not lost.
正相反  他明白了世界的真谛Far from it -- he's connected now.
别告诉我你也跟着他一起发疯Don't tell me you're following him into this madness.
说什么进化His talk of evolution...
我认同他  你才是跟着他的人I agree with him. You're the one who follows him.
但是在这件事上  你也该认同他But in this case, you should.

你是吗Are you?
那是你的天性Is that your true nature,
还是加勒特把你变成了那样呢or is that what Garrett made you to be?
我不知道I don't know.
我们知道斯凯的父母We know about Skye's parents,

什么事Yeah.
你好啊  约翰  好久不见Hi, John. Just calling to catch up.
斯凯Skye.
你在电话里的声音不太一样  更沙哑You sound different on the phone...huskier.
你想知道我为什么会从你的战士控制中心打给你吗You curious why I'm calling from your soldier control center?
不  我不怎么担心No, I'm not too concerned.
要知道  如果除指定负责人外的任何人You see, if anyone but the assigned handler
给我的战士下指令  他们就会爆炸gives a directive to one of my men, well, kaboom.
真讨厌  科尔森没想到你会搞这出Ah, darn it. Coulson didn't think of that.
又被你挫败了You outsmarted us again.
菲尔也在  好极了Phil's around? Great.
我们有很多话要说We actually have a lot to talk about.
对了  我想告诉你  你那两位科学家朋友Oh, and I wanted you to know -- your scientist friends...

我也爱你I love you, too.
我们得快点了All right, we need to hurry.
赶快行动  得有足够的氧...We have to do this soon. There has to be enough ox--
氧气来引燃  是的Oxygen to ignite, yes.
好了Okay.
我按下电源键后Now, when I press that power button...
窗户就会内爆  水会涌进来the window will blow in, and water will rush inwards.
那感觉就像是胃上被揍了无数拳Yeah, which is gonna be like 100 punches to the stomach, okay?
会把体内气息全部挤出体外The wind's gonna be knocked right out of us.
这瓶几乎用尽了  但我捣鼓了一下Now, this is near empty, but I've rigged it
让它喷出一股超高压to let out a burst of very high pressure --
应该能强行灌一口气进入你的肺部Should force a breath into your lungs,
但你一定得憋住这口气  憋住了but you have to hold on to it, okay? Hold on tight.
应该足够你游90英尺上去Should be enough to get you up the 90 feet or so.
只有一口气  但我们有两个人One breath? But there's two of us.
这我算过了Yeah, I've done the math.
所以你要拿着它That's why you're taking it.
你比我游泳好You're a better swimmer, anyway.
不No.

我不会丢下你一个人的I'm not leaving you here.
这不可能  我们得换个法子That's ridiculous. We need a new plan.
这不是在讨论  好吗We're not discussing it, okay?
你拿着  就这样定了You're taking it -- end of story.
如果你死了  我也活不下去I couldn't live if you didn't.
我也一样Well, I feel the same way.
肯定有别的方法There has to be another way.
你拿着You're taking it.
为什么  为什么要我这么做Why? Why would you make me do this?
你是我在这世上最好的朋友You're my best friend in the world!
可你对我来说不止是朋友  珍玛Yeah, and you're more than that, Jemma.
我一直没有勇气说出口I couldn't find the courage to tell you.
所以  求你了So, please...

这是减压舱  我们正在飞回美国本土You're in decompression on a jet back to the mainland.
他们都说你死了They told us you were dead.
很好Good.
我们就想把谣言传开We want word to get around on that.
菲兹Fitz.
别动  别动Uh, easy. Easy.
他还有心跳  不过很微弱His heart's still beating -- just barely.
有一整支医疗队在救他I have a full med team with him.
但你必须躺在减压舱里  好吗But you have to remain in this chamber, okay?
他的大脑缺氧了很长时间His brain was without oxygen for a long time,
但你救了他but you saved him.
是他救了我It was the other way around.
你怎么找到我们的How did you find us?
多亏了你们的简易信标  真聪明That makeshift beacon of yours -- good thinking
让我们发现了你们led us right to you.
幸好我们在留意找Lucky we were looking.
找什么You were looking?
找我哥们科尔森For my man Coulson.
我听说你们涉入了一场纷争I understand you're involved in a dispute
可能需要我帮助I might want to weigh in on.
你有什么办法带我找到他吗Do you have anything that might lead me to him?
看起来通往车间楼层的后门在南边Looks like the back entrance to the factory floor is on the south side.
收到Roger that.
我得每分钟按一下这上面的止爆键I have to hit "Snooze" on this every minute
才能防止它爆炸to keep that from blowing.
我死也不会说  但确实也没什么可说的Look, I will die before talking, but there's nothing to tell.
一定要有负责人在机器前下达指令There's no way of controlling the soldiers unless
才能控制那些战士there's an actual handler at the machine.
我对那些没兴趣I'm not interested in that.
我更想知道你为什么愿为九头蛇卖命I'm more interested in why you're willing to die for Hydra.
你真相信他们吗Are you a true believer?
九头蛇给了你从未有过的归属感吗Is Hydra the plucky little family you never had?
还是说你留在这儿是因为激励计划Or are you here because of the incentives program?
她不会杀你的She's not gonna kill you.
她曾有机会杀我但下不了手She had a chance to kill me before and couldn't do it.
她可恨透了我呢And she hates me... a lot.
真替你难过  你居然背叛了唯一I feel sorry for you -- betraying the only people
给你机会做个好人的人who gave you a chance at being a decent human being.
菲兹是个英雄  因为即便发生了那么多Fitz was a hero because he still wanted to give you
他还想给你一次机会that chance after everything.
但有些人大概就是生来邪恶吧But some people are just born evil, I guess.
是啊  可能确实如此Yeah. Yeah, maybe they are.
我知道了一些关于你的事  你的过去I've learned things about you, skye -- history --
你可能会想听听things you'll want to know.
你我其实没那么不同You and I aren't that different.
我说的邪恶不是指你You're not the evil I was referring to.
加勒特才是恶魔Garrett is evil.
你只是懦弱  只会照吩咐行事You're just weak, doing anything you're told.
真希望加勒特命令你自杀I hope Garrett orders you to walk into traffic.
你说得没错  斯凯You're right, Skye.
你唤醒了我内心的弱点You woke up a weakness inside me.
很久以来头一次And for the first time in a while,
我有了自己想要的东西I wanted something for myself.
或许我该夺下我想要的Maybe I'll just take what I want --
唤醒你内在的邪恶wake up something inside of you.
我不怕你  沃德I'm not afraid of you, Ward.
你不会引爆炸弹的You're not gonna kill us with the bomb.
那样你也会死You'd go, too.
确实不会No.
我有个比炸弹强得多的杀手锏I have a weapon much better than a bomb
会彻底摧毁你that will absolutely destroy you.
为什么呢And why's that?
因为你睡了她  她很恼火Because you slept with her, and she's really pissed off.
我们谈谈激励吧Let's talk about incentives.
你说过我们之间不谈感情的You said our thing was no strings attached.
看来冰霜女王还是伤感情了嘛Looks to me like the ice queen got her feelings hurt.
朋友们  敌人逼近Hey-ho, friends! The enemy approaches.

这可是新招式Well, that's new.
长官Sir?
你不需要叫我长官  科尔森You don't have to call me "Sir," Coulson.
你瞧瞧我Look at me.
我穿得就像桥底下的流浪汉I'm dressed like I live under a bridge.
你怎么会在这儿What are you doing here?
西蒙斯追踪了菲兹留在你们飞机上的Well, Simmons turned me on to that old-timey tracker
那个老式追踪器Fitz left on your bus.
你第一次死后  我费了好大劲才把你救回来I went to great pains to make sure you didn't die the first time.
我知道现在时机不太对  但...Well, now's probably not the best time, but...
我想跟你好好谈谈那事...i'd like to have a lengthy conversation with you about that.
我可能会用吼的It might get loud.
那是我欠你的And I owe you that.
但现在  我们还欠加勒特一拳But right now, we owe Garrett a punch in the teeth,
你说呢Wouldn't you say?
这个出拳挺狠的This... packs a pretty good punch.
我记得这家伙的厉害I know what it does.
《复仇者联盟》里用来打过洛基
让我想起了以前的好时光Reminds me of the old days.
你从来都没在上面You were never on top.
我们没时间了We are running out of time.

弗瑞Fury.
四个本已死去的人在这儿组合摔跤When was the last time anyone saw a tag-team wrestling match
真是奇观啊with four dead guys?
我只看到了一个死人I only see one dead guy in here.
优势可是在我们这边  伙计们Oh, the power's all on this side of the room, fellas.
菲尔  我很惊讶你居然想阻止我Phil, I'm surprised you'd try and stop me.
我当然不怪你  尼克Of course, I don't blame you, Nick.
你没有看到全局  宇宙爆炸You haven't seen the big picture, the big bang,
永恒的冰冻海洋  但是菲尔看到了the timeless frozen ocean, but Phil here has.
我们有紧密的联系We share a bond.
我们身上流着同样的血液We're blood brothers.
你没告诉我他都疯成这样了You didn't tell me he'd gone this crazy.
他确实又达到了新境界He's really stepped it up a notch.
等等  梅Wait, May!
这一刻我已经等太久了I think I've waited long enough for this.
凯尔Kyle?
宝贝Oh, baby.
我很抱歉他们这么对你I'm so sorry what they did to you.
你在找什么What are you looking for?
我们的杀手锏[艾斯]Our Ace in the hole.
还记得你常说的那番话吗  尼克You remember that speech you used to give us, Nick,
当人明白自己能做一番伟大的事业About how one man can accomplish anything once he realizes
便能无往不利he can be something bigger?
现在我明白了Well, now I am.
参与  参与一项伟大的事业A part -- a part of something bigger.
是这样说的吗Is that how it went?
当时没好好听吧Not a great listener.
别告诉我  你踏上九头蛇这条路If you tell me this whole hydra path thing you took
是因为听错了我的演说...is because you misheard my damn "One man" Speech...
我是宇宙未来的关键I am the key to the future of the universe.
-我是万物之始  -你当时听懂了吧- I'm the origin of all things. - You got it, right?
完全明白  一清二楚Totally. Loud and clear.
不  求你  不要No, come on, please, I --
不是吧Aww, man.
给你Here.
艾斯  我需要你帮我写条信息Okay, Ace, I need you to give me a message, okay?
一条你爸爸知道只有你会发出的信息Something your father would know could only come from you.
我得证明你在我这儿I need to prove I have you.
这没用的It won't matter.
我已经告诉你了I've already told you --
在这里面没法和死亡战士联系There's no way to communicate with Deathlok from in here.
我不需要I don't need to.
我一直在和他联系I've been communicating with him the whole time.
弗瑞对我们的训导是你不想听的  约翰Fury was teaching us something you didn't want to hear, John,
因为你眼中只有自己'cause you only think about yourself.
这就是你我两方的区别That's the difference between your side and our side
也是为什么我们总会赢and why we're always gonna win.
训导什么了  菲尔What lesson, Phil?
请点化点化我Please, enlighten me.
爸爸  我们是什么
爸爸  我们是什么
我们是一个团队
你不能这么做  麦克You can't do this, Mike.
我命令你退下I order you to stand down!
你必须服从我You must obey me!
你们需要我翻译造物者的意旨You need me to translate the words of creation.
你不会想这么做的  麦克You don't want to do this, Mike.
告诉他  菲尔Tell him, Phil!
彼得森先生想做什么都可以Mr. Peterson's free to do whatever he wants.
你觉得他得到教训了吗You think he learned his lesson?
至少是吃了苦头He learned something.
停止定期注射后  他们会变回普通人Without regular injections, they're just men.
等医生移除了他们的控制眼Once doctors remove their cybernetic eyes,
他们基本就能恢复正常they'll be essentially back to normal.
但少了只眼睛Minus an eye, of course.
你宣泄完所有感情了吗You got a chance to express all your feelings?
他不是还活着吗Is he still breathing?
看来她还是有所保留啊Guess she kept some of it to herself.
他现在没法说话He's having trouble speaking.
我好像打断了他的喉头I think I fractured his larynx.
漂亮Oh, good.
你除掉菲兹和西蒙斯的企图失败了Your attempt to cross off Fitz and Simmons failed,
但菲兹可能无法完全恢复But Fitz may never be the same again.
所以我会想些新办法来毁掉你今后的人生So I'm going to invent new ways to ruin the rest of your life.
我们会不择手段And we'll do whatever's necessary
从你这儿得到九头蛇的情报  但对你的折磨...to get Hydra intel from you, but your torture --
将会是内心上的that's gonna be internal.
也会有一些身体上的And a little bit external.
当然  也有身体上的Sure. Some of that.
你把你的一生都献给了一个精神错乱的自恋狂But you devoted your entire life to a deranged narcissist
他从没在乎过任何人  现在他死了who never gave a damn about anyone, and now he's dead.
你要用余生去纠结这个问题You've got the rest of your life to wrestle with the question --
没有了他  你又是谁Who are you without him?
你为什么不去见他Why don't you go to him?
我不想让他看到我变成了什么样I don't want him to see what I've become.
他不会在乎你的烧伤He won't care about your burns.
我不是说这个That's not what I mean.
科尔森说要带你回去Coulson said to bring you in.
你可以进入我的系统  监视我的一举一动You can access my hardware and watch my every move.
随你吧Go ahead.
我只会去弥补我造成的伤害I'll only be making amends for my actions.
不管你做了什么  都是为了艾斯 Whatever you did, you did it for Ace.
我现在做的And what I do now?
也是为了他That'll be for him, too.
所以说要"砍掉头"是有原因的There's a reason why they say, "cut off the head."
现在没人能阻挡...Now I'll be unstop--
各位Hey, guys!
我找到了I found it.
就说会在这里Told you it'd be in here.
愚蠢  残酷  非常愚蠢Stupid, stupid, stupid, and cruel, and very stupid!
你已经说得很明白了I think you've made your point.
为什么要让我复活Why bring me back in the first place?
显然我并不觉得这是个好主意Clearly, I didn't think it was the best idea.
我警告过你  测试对象会失去理智I warned you about people losing their minds.
梅特工一直在掌控全局Agent May was on top of the situation.
她说你没事She says you're fine.
对吗Aren't you?
那是"紧急情况下打碎玻璃"的状况It was a "Break glass in case of emergency" situation.
是啊  但这个紧急情况本该是复仇者受重伤Yes, but that emergency was supposed to be the fall of an avenger.
没错Exactly.
我很高兴我这样做了And I'm damn glad I did it, too.
你想建造东西就需要坚实的基础When you want to build something, you need a strong foundation.
你知道我信任的人很少  科尔森Now, you know how few people I trust, Coulson.
用一只手就能数完You can count them on one hand.
我不怕砍断手指And I'm not afraid to cut off fingers.
神盾局的基础原则十分纯粹The principle S.H.I.E.L.D. was founded upon was pure.
保护Protection.
保护  一个词Protection -- one word.
有时要保护一个人不被自己伤害Sometimes, to protect one man against himself --
有时候  要保护地球Other times, to protect the planet
抵御另一个宇宙的外星人的入侵against an alien invasion from another universe.
这是个宽泛的工作描述It's a broad job description.
这还用你说吗No need to tell me.
但驱使我们的信念是一致的But the belief that drives us all is the same,
不管是一个人还是整个人类whether it's one man or all mankind.
他们值得被拯救That they're worth saving.
那个真理一直在你心中长存  科尔森That truth lives inside you, Coulson.
神盾局解体前拥有很多部门Before it was torn apart, S.H.I.E.L.D. was a lot of moving parts.
你这样的人是核心Guys like you were the heart.
现在  你会成为首脑Now... you'll be the head.
这是什么What is it?
一个工具箱  来帮你重建神盾局A toolbox to help you build it back up.
你想让我重新开始  重建神盾局You want me to start over, rebuild S.H.I.E.L.D.

无处Nowhere?
你知道我不会这样的  菲尔You know me better than that, Phil.
我会无处不在I'll be everywhere.
菲兹  他没事吧Fitz -- is he okay?
拜托告诉我他没事Please tell me he's okay.
他还活着He's alive.
这是什么地方What is this place?
我在盒子里找到的第一样东西就是这里的坐标First thing I found in that box was these coordinates.
又是个秘密基地吧Another secret base?
我称这里为操场  但严格说来I call it the Playground, although, technically,
它没有名字  因为严格来说它并不存在it doesn't have a name because, technically, it doesn't exist,
因为是个秘密基地It being a secret base and all.
艾瑞克Eric?
比利·凯尼格  神盾局特工Billy...Koenig, agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.,
