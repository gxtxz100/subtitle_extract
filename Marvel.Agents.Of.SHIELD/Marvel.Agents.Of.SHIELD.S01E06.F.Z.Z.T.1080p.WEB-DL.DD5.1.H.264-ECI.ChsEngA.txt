神盾局特工第一季 第六集By aBu 201705
宾夕法尼亚州  瑞格利
问题是  没人知道Thing is, no one exactly knows
那年夏天"哭泣的男人"到底怎么了what happened to the crying man that summer.
有人说他在湖里溺死了Some say that he drowned in the lake,
但也有人说见过他的鬼魂but others say that they've seen his ghost,
在森林里游荡  寻找他失散的妹妹wandering these woods, in search for his lost sister.
事实上  据说如果你们非常安静  仔细听Actually, they say if you're quiet and listen real hard...
还能听到他的哭声You can still hear him crying.
克洛斯先生  那是最烂的"哭泣的男人"的模仿Mr. Cross, that was, like, the worst crying man ever.
是吗  我还觉得挺不错呢Really? I thought it was pretty good.
你们以为我们在开玩笑吗You guys think we're kidding.
今晚记得一定待在营火旁Just remember to stick close to the campfire tonight, okay?
伙计们  你们听到了吗Hey, guys. Do you hear that?
听到什么Hear what?
嗡嗡声That humming sound.
待在这儿  我去野营地周围查看一下Stay here. I'm gonna take a look around the campground.
什么嗡嗡声What humming?
克洛斯先生去哪W-where's Mr. Cross going?
他就是想吓吓咱们He's just trying to scare us.
手段太低端So lame.
来吧  再来点Come on, guys. Grab a s'more.
给你Well, that's for you.
我要棉花糖Ooh, I want the marsh-- ooh, marshmallows!
汤米  我知道你喜欢巧克力  给Now, I know -- Tommy, I know you like chocolates. Here.
别独占着棉花糖Don't hog the marshmallows, okay?
所有人到卡车上去Everyone to the truck now!
快Go, go! Go!
开门  快Open the door. Hurry up.
克洛斯先生Mr. Cross?
克洛斯先生Mr. Cross!
走  伙计们Come on, guys.
我们去找他Let's go look for him.
跟紧了Stay close.
克洛斯先生  你还好吗Mr. Cross, are you okay?
他在哪Where is he?
克洛斯先生Mr. Cross!
我们应该回去We should just go back.
汗出的不少啊  长官Working up a good sweat there, sir?
那不是流汗I don't sweat.
那叫闪闪发光I glisten.
血压  心率  生化数据都正常Blood pressure, heart rate, biochems -- all normal.
只剩下采血了All that's left is the blood sample.
你应该知道You should know --
我不喜欢被捅的感觉I'm not a fan of getting poked.
长官  有个问题Tell me, sir --
你最近感觉身体不适吗Have you been feeling under the weather lately?
为什么这么问Why?
只是表格上注明I just noticed from your chart
你三个月后才需要做体检呢that you're not due for a general physical for another three months.
我犯傻  接了我理疗师的电话I made a mistake -- took a call from my physical therapist.
问我"身体如何"  我说"不是太好"Asked how I was feeling. I said, "A little rusty."
结果就被拴在这仓鼠轮子上了Next thing you know, I'm wired to this hamster wheel.
你可以正式通知你的理疗师Well, you can officially tell your physical therapist
你的身体状况极佳that you're fit as the proverbial fiddle,
尤其是对你这年龄的人来说especially for a man of your age.
我这年龄的人A man of my age?
那是对老人说的话That's something you say to an old person.
是吗Is it?
给你拿点电解质饮料吧Well, let's get you some electrolytes, shall we?
抱歉  菲兹Sorry, Fitz.
很接近  但还是不行It's close, but it's just not right.
是吗Really?
可是科尔森特工用得挺顺手啊'cause Agent Coulson had no problems.
重了一盎司It's an ounce too heavy.
一盎司  不是吧你An ounce? Seriously?
一盎司就是成功与失败的差别It's the difference between success and failure.
如果你在楼顶  风速每小时15英里When you're on a rooftop with a 15-mile-an-hour wind,
目标在五百码之外your target is 500 yards away --
但我们还有把来复枪Yeah, but we do have a rifle.
减掉那一盎司Lose the ounce.
好的  这就去办Yeah, okay. On it.
减掉那一盎司"Lose the ounce."
我是格兰特·沃德特工I'm Agent Grant Ward,
我能在五百码外射掉跳蚤的腿and I can shoot the legs off a flea from 500 yards,
只要风不是太大as long as it's not windy.
好久没听到你这样笑了Hey. That's a sound I haven't heard in a bit.
如果沃德也对你冷着个脸Yeah, well, you wouldn't be laughing a whole lot
你大概也不会经常笑了if you were living in Ward's doghouse.
你对我们所有人都道歉了You made the rounds, apologized to us all.
他还想怎么样呢What more can he ask?
我也不知道I don't know.
我已经很努力了I have been busting my ass,
记住了所有的神盾局规章手册memorizing every S.H.I.E.L.D. protocol manual,
服从每一条命令following every order.
"是  长官"  "不  长官""Yes, sir." "No, sir."
我甚至同意像个流浪狗一样戴着个吊牌I even let them tag me like a stray dog.
我知道我对你们撒谎了I mean, I know I lied to you guys,
但我那是为了保护我男朋友but I was trying to protect my boyfriend.
其实  我们都会犯错You know, we all make mistakes.
谁在乎  我不在乎and who ca-- I don't care --
谁会在乎你前男友怎样呢who cares about your ex-boyfriend?
我倒不是拿沃德和迈尔斯比较It's not like I'm comparing Ward to Miles,
但和迈尔斯在一起时but at least with Miles,
我不用担心这种消极对抗式的行为I didn't have to worry about passive-aggressive stuff.
我们不会玩什么心理游戏There was no mind games.
-我们志趣相投  你懂吗  -对啊- We spoke the same language, you know?  -Yeah.
-对啊  就像我们那样  -对的- Yeah, a bit like we do. -Totally.
你和西蒙斯的关系太好了You and Simmons are so tight,
就好像你们有心灵感应一样it's like you're psychically linked.
不  事实上没有  我不这么觉得No, you -- no. Actually, no. I don't think so.
沃德来了  我猜猜So, Ward was here? Let me guess --
又说"好梦"枪的事了the night-night pistol again?
是啊Yeah.
对了  他说重了一盎司Oh, yeah, and he said it was off by an ounce.
他当然这么说了Of course he did.
我可是格兰特·沃德特工I'm Agent Grant Ward,
我用左手小指就能打爆你的脾脏and I could rupture your spleen with my left pinky --
蒙着眼睛都行blindfolded!
简直太像了That is dead on.
快准备一下  拿好装备Hey. Hustle up and grab your gear.
我们要出任务了We're on a mission.
有什么好笑的吗Something funny?
可怜的傻菲兹Poor, silly Fitz.
他把一颗训练弹留在枪里了He mistakenly left a dummy round in the pistol.
现在应该符合要求了Should be proper now.
不错Great.
谢谢Thanks.
领队叫亚当·克洛斯Troop leader's name was Adam Cross.
据称他说听到树林里有动静Apparently, he said he heard something in the woods,
就去查看一下went to check it out.
然后就发生了静电异常That's where the electrostatic anomaly occurred.
我不明白的是What I don't understand is,
这种异常一般由大型雷暴引起usually, they're caused by a massive electrical storm...
但昨晚一千英里范围内没有任何风暴发生But there wasn't a storm within a thousand miles of here last night.
这次异常不太一样This anomaly's different --
它伴随着一种我们从没见过的副作用It has a side effect we've never seen before.
汽车蓄电池直接击穿引擎盖飞出来了The battery blew straight up through the hood.
落在了这里Landed over here.
要多大力量才能炸出这样的轨迹Hell of a force to create that kind of trajectory.
你在干嘛What are you doing?
我在追随我的监管人员I'm shadowing my supervising officer.
追随  别贴上了Shadowing, not smothering.
那棵树上到处是焦痕There's scorch marks all over that tree.
幸好没把整片树林都烧掉Lucky the whole forest didn't burn down.
我不明白I don't get it.
这个电击什么的Seems to me like this electroshock thing
似乎是奇怪的雷击was some freak lightning strike.
干嘛叫我们来  有什么特别...I mean, why call us? What's the big --
当我没说Never mind.
这种死法真是太可怜了So sad a man died this way...
但也好神奇and yet, so amazing.
菲兹-西蒙斯  能想到这种现象是怎么造成的吗Fitz-simmons, any idea what could cause an effect like this?
-从水平的放电  -有一个孤子假说- Well, judging by the horizontal... - There's the soliton hypothesis.
-也许是纳米电池  -形式判断...- Perhaps, nanobatteries  - ...electrical discharge, it could be --
打住Time.
我重问一次Let's try that again.
知道这种现象是怎么造成的吗Any idea what could cause an effect like this?
-我怎么知道  -完全不知道- The hell if I know.  -Uh, no, no clue.
在我看来  这要么是Seems to me like we're either dealing
诡异的自然现象  要么就是新高科技武器with some freak natural event or a new high-tech weapon.
或是你们秘密名录里的什么人Or could it be someone from your uber-secret Index?
名录里没有人有这种能力There's no one on the Index with this type of power.
据我们所知没有That we know of.
我会联系神盾局总部的布莱克特工I'll contact Agent Blake at S.H.I.E.L.D. HQ,
让他去查证一下have him check it out.
不管这是谁或者什么东西引起的Whoever or whatever's responsible,
我们不能让这种事再发生了we can't let this happen again.
菲兹  看他的额头Fitz, see his forehead?
你看内皮的变色Look at that endothelial discoloration.
跟卡车上的撞痕有同样的扩散模式Yeah, same dispersal pattern as the strike on the truck.
可能是迅速烧灼的射入伤Could be an entry wound cauterized immediately.
吓人Freaky.
真吓人Freaky.
你在克洛斯身上发现什么了吗You found something on Cross?
很多东西  不过你们都已经知道了Many things, actually, but you already knew that,
多亏这个漂亮的神盾局软禁小玩意thanks to my fancy S.H.I.E.L.D. house-arrest gizmo
追踪我每一次刷门禁卡tracking my every key swipe,
我的在线活动  我的胆固醇my online activity, my cholesterol.
就是希望能换个颜色  或者干脆去掉Just wish it came in another color...or came off.
被害人情况The victim?
亚当·克洛斯  单身  没孩子Adam Cross -- single, no kids,
来自宾州瑞格利originally from Wrigley, Pennsylvania,
离这儿不远not far from here.
去过那儿Been there.
他们春天会举办一个草莓节They have a nice little strawberry festival in the spring.
职业Occupation?
当地高中体育老师  校队足球教练Phys-ed teacher at the local high school and varsity baseball coach
童子军领队  以及义务消防员and troop leader and volunteer firefighter.
这家伙把美国队长比得像"督爷"This guy makes Captain America look like "The dude."
《谋杀绿脚趾》"The Big Lebowski."
不会没看过吧Seriously?
有没有犯罪记录  限制令What about a criminal record, restraining order,
任何有嫌疑的东西something that might give us a suspect?
完全没有  连停车罚单都没有Nada -- not even a parking ticket.
我浏览了他所有邮件  和他主页相关的人I skimmed all his posts, anyone linked to his pages,
想找到一个疯狂前任或是超能力跟踪狂hoping for a crazy ex or superpowered stalker,
但他很清白and he's clean.
初次调查时任何人看起来都挺清白Everybody looks clean on their first go-round.
沃德说的对Ward's right.
我们遗漏了什么  继续查We're missing something. Dig deeper.
你对她很严厉啊You've been pretty tough on her.
她骗了我们She lied to us --
在我们执行任务时联络涨潮组织contacted the Rising Tide while we were on mission.
如果还想让我们信任她  就得自己争取If she wants our trust back, she's got to earn it.
她对克洛斯做的背景调查是个好开端The background she ran on Cross is a good start.
放到服务器上Put it up on the server.
让梅结束审问后看看I want May to have a look when she's done with her interrogation.
吃块饼干吧Have a cookie.
来的正好  长官Excellent timing, Sir.
我刚完成被害人大脑矢状和冠状面图像分析I've been analyzing sagittal and coronal images of the victim's brain.
菲兹在外头干什么What's Fitz doing out there?
他检测到尸体散发出一种奇怪的能量He detected a strange energy coming off the body.
他害怕了  是吗He's afraid of it, isn't he?
是味道太难闻It's the smell!
这没什么丢脸的  菲兹There's no shame in it, Fitz.
觉得害怕是很正常的It's perfectly natural to be afraid.
不  我唯一害怕的事No, the only thing I'm afraid of
是腐臭变质的尸体is putrid, decaying flesh
弄脏我干干净净的工作室corrupting my pristine workspace.
还记得上次你把一个死物带进实验室吗Do you remember the last time you brought a dead thing into the lab?
不会又说那只猫吧Oh, not the stupid cat again.
-那只猫  -而且是我们的实验室  菲兹- The cat -- And it's our lab, Fitz,
-跟他说说那只猫  -不是你的实验室- tell him about the cat! - Not your lab.
你把它的肝脏放在我的午饭旁边You left his liver next to my lunch!
伙计们Guys!
我们可不可以...Can we please...
是  长官Yes, sir.
如我所言  这是被害人的大脑Um, as I was saying, this is the victim's brain.
看上去像烧焦的烤土豆Looks like a burnt baked potato.
这就是That's what happens when it's hit
被近两千兆焦的静电能量击中的后果with close to 2,000 megajoules of electrostatic energy.
几乎是闪电能量的两倍That's almost double the power of a lightning bolt.
那小子没问题Kid's clean.
你搞清楚尸体为什么会悬浮了吗You figure out why the body was floating?
还没有Not yet.
被害人的分子密度The molecular density of the victim
被未知能量源暂时改变了was temporarily altered by an unknown energy source.
希望我提取出脑组织样本后I'm hoping to shed some light on its effects
能进一步了解它的效果once I extract a brain-tissue sample.
-又来了  -这是科学好吗  菲兹- It's happening again!  - It's science, fitz!
我总得解剖看看啊I have to dissect something.
不是  卫星探测到No, the satellite's picking up
另一起静电事件  据此不到20公里another electrostatic event not 20 kilometers from here.
菲兹  最新的读数是多少Fitz, what's the latest reading?
现在是324兆焦  还在持续变强...We're at 324 megajoules and growing stronger...
危险水平  长官dangerous territory, sir.
你位置以北一英里处有间农舍There's a farmhouse a mile north of you,
处于信号正中央right at the center of the signal.
应该就是它了That's got to be it.
斯凯  尽可能查出关于农场住户的一切Skye, dig up everything you can on whoever lives at that farm.
我们得搞清楚要对付的是谁We need to know who we're dealing with.
等一下  刚刚发生了什么Hold on, now. What just happened?
消失了Um, it's gone.
-什么消失了  -静电信号...- What's gone?  -The electrostatic signal...
似乎脉冲放电后消失了it seemed to pulse, then disappear.
我们得抄近路We need a shortcut.
门从里面挡上了Door's barred from the inside.
阁楼的干草棚开着Hayloft's open.
我们可以用车撞开We could ram it with the truck.
或者...Or...
搜索周边Scan the perimeter.
无论凶手是谁  不可能走远Whoever did this couldn't have gotten far.
把自己堵在里面  然后去拿猎枪Barricaded himself inside. Went for his shotgun.
他是害怕  想要保护自己He was scared, trying to protect himself.
是在害怕谁  他们怎么找上他的From who? How did they get to him?
前额上也有烧痕Another burn mark on the forehead.
没有任何人的踪迹No sign of anyone...
没有车辙  路上也没有其他车辆no tracks, no vehicles down the road.
斯凯  我们需要这片区域的Skye, we need real-time sat surveillance
实时卫星监控  立刻on this area right now.
稍等Hang on.
我好像发现了些线索  你可能想先看看I think I found something you might want to see first.
正在发送过去Sending it over now.
发送文件到"小队"组
亚当·克洛斯
弗兰克·维伦
农场主的名字是弗兰克·维伦The guy who owns the farm's name is Frank Whalen.
他与第一名被害人亚当·克洛斯He's a volunteer firefighter at the same station house
是同一个消防队的志愿消防员as our first victim, Adam Cross.
两名被害人相互认识Our two victims knew each other.
他们同是外星人入侵纽约时的急救员They were both responders when the aliens crashed New York.
两名被害人来自同一消防队Two victims from the same firehouse,
又都死得离奇found in the same weird way.
我们是在找一个杀手We're looking for a killer.
接住你了Gotcha!
注意到尸体周围这些散落的金属了吗Hey, um, anyone else notice all the metal scattered around the body,
像是之前曾有电磁场like an electromagnetic field was present?
问题是  由什么产生的The question is, what created it?
我们得尽快把尸体弄回实验室We need to get this body back to the lab as soon as possible.
这些伤口...Something about these wounds...
斯凯  关于消防队有什么发现吗Skye, what did you find out about the firehouse?
奇塔瑞入侵后消防队曾派出一辆救火车It turns out they sent an engine to New York
连同12名志愿消防员去了纽约with a dozen volunteers after the Chitauri invasion,
其中包括克洛斯和维伦including Cross and Whalen.
也许这与他们成为目标有关Maybe it has something to do with why they were targeted?
还有他们是如何被杀Or how they were killed.
你是指...外星武器吗You mean like... an alien weapon?
我们先确保赶在其他人之前Let's just make sure we get to those firefighters
找到那些消防员吧before anyone else does.
晚上好  先生们Evening, gentlemen.
神盾局的菲尔·科尔森特工Agent Phil Coulson with S.H.I.E.L.D.
纽约之战我们也跟你们一样在现场We were on the ground with you in New York.
神盾局  没错S.H.I.E.L.D., right.
你们来有什么事What's this all about?
我们想问你们几个问题We'd like to ask you a few questions.
四处看看Take a look around.
伙计们...发生什么事了Hey, guys. What's, uh -- what's going on?
你在找什么What are you looking for?
-香薰蜡烛  -不是说你- A scented candle. - Not you.
这个伤口  看上去有点奇怪This wound -- something doesn't quite make sense.
本来  我以为这是射入伤Initially, I thought these were entry wounds,
就像枪击那样as if from a gunshot.
但其实不是But they're not --
这是射出伤they're exit wounds.
你说什么  弗兰克死了吗  What do you mean? Frankie's dead?
-我很遗憾  -你知道他是怎么死的吗- I'm very sorry.  - You know how it happened?
跟前一天你们另一位朋友The same way your other friend,
克洛斯先生的死因一样Mr. Cross, died the day before.
那到底是什么Which was how, exactly?
不好意思  请问你是...I'm sorry. Your name is...?
我叫托尼  托尼·迪亚兹Tony. Tony Diaz.
你还好吗  迪亚兹先生You okay, Mr. Diaz?
事实上...Actually, uh...
不太好I'm actually not feeling so hot.
沃德  守住后门Ward, cover the back door.
别让任何人出入Nobody comes in or out.
会不会这种武器让大脑过载What if this weapon overloaded the brain
使电容超过临界点past the threshold of its electrical capacity,
导致大脑放电  就像电磁脉冲那样causing it to discharge, like an E.M.P.?
你觉得这是外部条件导致的You're assuming we're dealing with an external source.
我却认为是他体内的什么造成的I'm saying it was something from inside him.
有事发生了Something's happening --
卫星又探测到了一个读数The satellite's picking up another reading.
来自消防局It's coming from the firehouse.
那嗡嗡声  你听到了吗That humming noise -- you hear that?
我没听到No. I don't.
上次奇塔瑞入侵事件后Were you in New York
你跟克洛斯先生和维伦先生都去纽约了吗with Mr. Cross and Mr. Whalen after the chitauri invasion?
你真的没听到吗Come on. You don't hear that?
快把我逼疯了It's driving me nuts.
迪亚兹先生  你在听我说话吗Mr. Diaz, are you with me?
无论你在做什么  快停下Whatever you're doing, make it stop.
我什么都没做I-I'm not doing anything!
-武器在哪里  -什么武器- Where's the weapon?  -The what?
科尔森  我找到了Coulson, I found it.
是个奇塔瑞头盔It's a chitauri helmet.
菲兹-西蒙斯  你们看到了吗Fitz-Simmons, are you seeing this?
这不是个武器It's not a weapon,
但它会导致脑部放电Yet it caused a cranial discharge.
你对那头盔做了什么What are you doing with the helmet?
什么  那个外星物件吗What, the -- the alien thing?
那只是个纪念品I-it's a souvenir.
怎么又这样Aah! Not again!
回答我的问题  迪亚兹先生Answer the question, Mr. Diaz --
你对那头盔做了什么What are you doing with the helmet?
从纽约回来后  直到几晚前The first time anyone's touched it since New York
-我们才第一次碰它  -为什么- was a couple nights ago.  -Why?
上面都生锈了  我们只是想擦擦It had rust all over it. We were cleaning it.
那不是锈迹That wasn't rust.
梅  别碰它May, don't touch it!
长官  那不是武器  他是被感染了Sir, he's not using a weapon -- he's infected.
我认为头盔上带有外星病毒I think the helmet was the source of an alien virus.
我们只是擦拭了一下  我发誓All we did was clean it -- I swear.
我  弗兰克  还有亚当Me, Frankie, and Adam -- we --
我们值第三班时觉得无聊We were bored on the third shift, so --
就决定去擦它一下So we decided to clean it.
亚当和弗兰克...Adam and Frankie...
迪亚兹先生  我现在把枪收起来Mr. Diaz, I'm putting the gun away now, okay?
长官  他已经达到了600兆焦  还在上升Sir, he's at 600 megajoules and climbing.
长官Sir?
让大家都出去Clear everybody out.
让大家都出去  快Clear everybody out now.
我会像他们一样死去  是吗I-I'm gonna wind up like them, aren't I?
坐下吧Why don't you have a seat?
你有家人吗You have any family --
妻子或是小孩wife, kids?
有任何你想联络的人吗Is there anyone you want to talk to?
有什么我能帮你的吗Anything I can do?
长官  你必须马上撤离那里Sir, you have to get out of there right now!
他就要...He's going to --
听我说Listen to me.
你这种状况我也经历过I've been where you are right now.
所以请你相信我So please believe me when I tell you
你不必害怕you don't have to be afraid.
你在说什么What are you -- what are you talking about?
你的工作Your job --
很危险  不是吗gets pretty dangerous, doesn't it?
我也一样Mine, too.
我受过一次伤I got hurt once --
伤得很重pretty bad.
我...And I...
我死了I died.
有人说只有8秒钟Some say it was only for 8 seconds,
但我知道远不止8秒but I know it was more than that.
我知道我那时不在人世了I know I wasn't here anymore.
我在那边I was there.
那边是什么样的What's it like?
很美It's beautiful.
你得走了  伙计You better get going, buddy.
走吧Go.
全部正常  无静电能迹象All clean -- no traces of electrostatic energy.
别的消防员呢What about the other firefighters?
他们会去神盾局的一个They'll be quarantined and observed
生物危害设施隔离观察at a S.H.I.E.L.D. biohazard facility.
你们注意到Um, anyone else notice
他们把被感染的外星物件放在我们车上了吗they're putting the infected alien thing on our truck?
我们要送它去"沙箱"We're flying it to the Sandbox.
"沙箱"Sandbox?
是大西洋那边的一个神盾局研究设施It's a S.H.I.E.L.D. research facility across the Atlantic.
他们专门研究危险物件They specialize in hazardous materials.
如果你的猜测是对的If what you suspect is true,
如果这真是病毒that this is a virus,
那这些消防员可能已经被感染了then those firefighters could be infected,
他们就会需要解药and they're gonna need a cure.
找出来Find one.
是  长官Yes, sir.
我们的预计到达时间是几点What's our E.T.A.?
西非时间3点37分3:37 West Africa time.
这4小时26分钟会很难熬Gonna be a long 4 hours and 26 minutes.
你没事吧You okay?
还好Fine.
我只是希望能尽早摆脱这个外星物件I just want this alien thing off our plane as soon as humanly possible.
你想谈谈你的体检吗You want to talk about your physical?
没什么好谈的Nothing to tell.
这是我理疗师的要求My physical therapist requested it.
他在更新病例还是什么He's updating his files or something.
如果有问题  你会告诉我  是吧You'd tell me if something was wrong.
当然Of course.
长官  我想我有发现Sir, I think I've discovered something.
你能来下实验室吗Could you come down to the lab?
我这就过去I'll be right there.
菲尔Phil.
那个消防员The fireman --
你已经尽自己最大努力了you did everything you could for him.
显微镜图片
我到底该看什么So, what am I looking for exactly?
等着吧Wait for it.
那是什么What was that?
一个开拓性的发现A groundbreaking discovery!
我认为消防员最初沾染病毒I believe the firefighters initially contracted the virus
是在擦拭头盔的时候when they cleaned the helmet,
摩擦力激活了某种早已衰减的奇塔瑞有机体the friction activating some long-decaying chitauri organism --
等等Hang on.
这些细胞来自消防员的尸体吗These cells are from the bodies of the firefighters?
是的  脑细胞  感染的最后残留部分Brain cells, yes -- the last vestiges of the infection.
有些病毒会在宿主细胞中"沉睡"数年后再繁殖Some viruses "sleep" inside host cells for years before reproducing,
在感染源  头盔里就是如此as they did inside the helmet -- the initial source.
但这些细胞表明But what those cells tell us is that
这种病毒可以传播  也就是说we're dealing with a propagating virus, which means --
病毒会在人与人之间传播The virus can move from person to person.
没错Exactly!
而最让人兴奋的是And that's the most exciting part --
它的传播方式how it spreads --
不是通过空气或者直接液体接触传播Not through the air or through direct fluid transfer,
而是通过静电冲击but through electric static shock.
地球上从没出现过这种现象It's like nothing we've ever seen on earth.
我认为病毒是不能改变I didn't think it possible a virus could alter
其宿主的分子密度和极性的its host's molecular density and polarity.
这也是被害人悬浮的原因That explains the floating.
真等不及让疾控中心和I can't wait till the virologists
神盾局总部的病毒学家看到这个了at the CDC and S.H.I.E.L.D. HQ see this.
长官  有什么事吗Sir, is something wrong?
对不起  珍玛I'm so sorry, Jemma.
糟了Oh, no.
西蒙斯认为她是大约36小时前Simmons believes she contracted the virus
受到来自第一个被害人的静电冲击时approximately 36 hours ago when she received an electrostatic shock
感染上病毒的from the first victim.
她还有多少时间How much time does she have?
根据消防员从受感染Based on when the firemen were infected,
到出现症状的时间how quickly their symptoms manifested...
最多还有两个小时two hours at most.
两小时够了  对吧That's enough time, right?
神盾局不是有几十个实验室I mean, S.H.I.E.L.D. has dozens of labs
以及成群的科学家在研究这个吗and scientists working on this thing, don't they?
确实是They do.
降落最快要多久How soon can you get us on the ground?
三个小时Three hours.
我们因为要飞往沙盒  所以现在在大西洋中心Our path to the Sandbox has us right in the middle of the Atlantic.
长官  这样一来  我们如果不能及时降落...Sir, correct me if I'm wrong, but if we can't land in time...
西蒙斯会释放脉冲Simmons will release a pulse
将这架飞机在空中炸毁that will blow this plane right out of the sky.
我们不能眼睁睁地看着她死We can't just sit here and watch her die.
我们得做点什么We have to do something.
这架飞机上只有一个人There's only one person on this plane
能找到解决办法capable of finding a solution for this,
我愿拿性命打赌注  她一定能找到and I'm willing to bet my life that she will.
她还只是个孩子She's just a kid.
我想我找到了最好的办法I believe we have a winner.
快速而高效  完美的施放装置Fast and efficient -- the perfect delivery mechanism.
要找到一种能延缓疫苗Uh, hey, um, not that it was easy to find a mineralized
且导电的矿化溶液可不是易事solution that could suspend the vaccine and conduct electricity.
我不喜欢你用"疫苗"这个词I wish you wouldn't use the word "vaccine".
这其实更像是抗血清It's really more of an antiserum.
好吧Okay, so...
这些抗体应该能找到病毒的抗原These antibodies should be able to target the virus' antigens,
如果这该死的外星病毒有抗原if this bloody alien virus even has antigens.
加油Come on, now.
加油Come on.
小家伙不怎么配合啊  是吧Well...that wasn't very cooperative of him, now, was it?
你怎么不下去看看Why aren't you down there?

做任何需要我们做的事For whatever it is we're called upon to do.
科尔森  很高兴看到你生龙活虎Coulson, nice to see you're not dead.
你拿到我们对病毒的分析报告了吗Did you get our analysis of the virus?
拿到了  神盾局没有任何类似记录We did, and S.H.I.E.L.D. has no record of anything like it.
没人有No one does.
你们务必顺利到达沙盒So it's imperative it reach the Sandbox without incident.
如果爆发传染病  我们会需要它In case of a pandemic, we're going to need it.
我很清楚I'm aware of that,
但我需要的不是命令或通牒but I don't need more orders or ultimatums.
我需要的是答案I need answers.
我也希望我有答案I wish I had some for you.
很抱歉  科尔森  上头让我通知你I'm sorry, Coulson -- I've been ordered to inform you
如果机上有被感染物  你需要丢掉它that if you have infected cargo, you need to dump it.
听到了吗  科尔森Do you copy me, Coulson?
这是上层下来的命令These orders are coming from up top.
不好意思  信号不好I'm sorry -- bad connection.
没听到最后的部分Didn't get that last part.
想都别想Don't even think it.
我不需要  那是你的工作I don't have to. That's your job.
没事的  一切都会好起来It's all right. Everything's gonna be fine.
别再这样说了Please stop saying that.
我知道你一直在看表I see you looking at your watch.
你确定不需要我帮你...Are you sure you don't need my help just to --
你确定这东西好使吗Are you sure this thing even works?
当然了Yeah, well, you know it does.
我的设备不是问题  是疫苗My device isn't the issue -- it's the vaccine.
抗血清Antiserum!
我只是怀疑你的校准够不够准确And all I'm wondering is whether you calibrated it correctly.
才不是设备的问题  别怪到我头上Hey, it's not the device. Hey, don't put this on me.
我本来好好的I was doing just fine,
安安全全地在学院的固定室内实验室工作tucked away in a safe, indoor, non-mobile lab at the academy!
你非得带我们到这个空中马戏团来Oh! Then you had to go and drag us into this flying circus!
我们连外勤评估都没通过Didn't even pass our field assessments, for god's sake!
拜托  别说得像我逼着你跟着我似的Oh, please, as if I forced you to follow me anywhere.
你的原话是You said, and I quote...
"菲兹"Oh, fitz,
这是我们见识世界最完美的机会了it's the most perfect opportunity for us to see the world!
错过这种机会太傻了"We'd be fools to pass this one up!"
我讨厌你那个腔调说话I hate it when you use that voice.
我才不那么说话呢That's not even how I sound.
你不过是害怕出外勤而已And you were just afraid of going into the field.
-我才不害怕  -而且你别装得像- I was not afraid. - And don't you dare act like
这几个月不是你枯燥人生中最精彩的部分these last months haven't been the highlight of your entire pasty life!
枯燥  是吗Pasty? Oh, really?
难道你就常出门闯荡吗Well, when did you become so sun-kissed?
因为我确定每一天的每一分钟Because I'm pretty sure that every minute of every day,
你都跟我一起待在实验室里you've been stuck in a lab right beside me.
无论是在学院  科研部  还是在飞机上At the academy, at sci-ops, this plane --
你一直都在我身边you've been beside me the whole damn time!
你一定要想到办法You have to fix this.
我不知道怎么做  菲兹I don't know how, fitz.
这三个消防员的抗体The antibodies from the three firefighters
都不足以抵御这病毒aren't strong enough to fight this virus.
它来自外星基因It's born from alien DNA.
我们没有任何东西There's no one...
可以用来创造抗血清to create an antiserum from.
因为还没有谁在感染病毒后活了下来Because no one's actually survived this
除了except...
-那个奇塔瑞人  -那个奇塔瑞人- The chitauri. - The chitauri.
当初戴这个头盔的混蛋就感染了病毒Well, the minky bastard who actually wore the helmet had the virus...
没错  而且没有放出静电脉冲Yeah, and managed to survive without ever emitting
活了下来  因为an electrostatic pulse because...
-它对病毒免疫  -对- It was immune. - Yes.
她只是个携带者  跟伤寒带菌者一样She -- she was just the carrier, like typhoid mary.
她  不  等等Uh, "She"? Well, no, wait.
那...你不会真觉得  算了That -- you don't really think that -- okay, doesn't matter.
那如果我从头盔内Um, so if -- if I can scrape some epithelial
刮取一些上皮细胞  就能造出疫苗吗cells from the inside of the helmet, we can create a vaccine?
没错Yes!
是抗血清  不过没错Antiserum, but yes.
-那不是  -菲兹- Isn't that... - fitz!
不  你不能进来No, uh... you can't be in here.
太迟了  我都进来了Too late. It's done.
你尽量别碰我就是了  好吗Just try and do your best to keep your hands off me, yeah?
菲兹  我不知道你是想干什么  但Fitz, I don't know what you think you're doing, but --
我只是在做我们一直做的事I'm doing what we always do.
我们能搞定的  我们一起We're gonna fix this -- together.
第三次总有好运Third time's a charm.
可以让我来吗May I do the honors?
我无法呼吸了I can't breathe.
我们做到了We did it.
不要No.
长官Sir,
我知道这种情况下要执行的程序I know the protocol in these circumstances,
但你能先告诉我爸吗but could you please tell my dad first?
我只是觉得如果由他来说  我妈更能接受I just think my mum would take it better if it comes from him.
我们还没到那一步  还有时间We're not there yet. There's still time.
长官  拜托了Sir, please.
能让我和菲兹独处一会儿吗Would you mind if I had a brief moment alone with Fitz?
走吧Come on. Let's go.
我们再试一次We'll try again.
第三只老鼠身上的静电脉冲似乎弱了很多The electrostatic pulse from the third rat seemed much less,
我们有进展so we're making progress.
如果我们能调整抗血清If we can calibrate the antiserum...
抗血清Antiserum, yes.
你终于说对了  菲兹You finally got it right, Fitz.
对不起I'm so sorry.
布莱克特工在线上  他想知道这边的情况Agent Blake is on the line. He wants to know what's going on.
如果你不接电话  他会找沃德If you won't answer, he asked for Ward.
长官  我们的命令是什么Sir... what are our orders?
保持不变They're unchanged.
这是什么What is that?
有人正在降下货仓舷梯Someone's lowering the cargo-hold ramp.
搞什么鬼What the hell.
成功了It worked.
脉冲只是把老鼠击昏了而已The pulse just knocked the rat unconscious.
珍玛Jemma?
珍玛Jemma!
珍玛  成功了Jemma, it worked!!
不要啊  珍玛  不要Please, don't! No! Jemma! No!
珍玛Jemma!!

抗血清成功了  可她跳下去了The antiserum worked, but she jumped!
别误会了Don't get me wrong!
你俩还活着  我很高兴I'm happy you're both alive. Truly.
我知道你是想拯救整个团队And I realize you were trying to save the team,
但你今天的做法  那不是你能决定的but what you did today -- that was not your call.
光是把你们从水里救上来Just getting you out of the water --
你知道应付摩洛哥办事处有多头疼吗Do you have any idea what a pain it is dealing with the Moroccan Office?
不许再这样乱来了Don't you ever pull a stunt like that again.
我们不想失去你  珍玛We'd hate to lose you, Jemma.
谢谢  长官Thank you, sir.
那我们现在可以走了吗Oh, does that mean we're to leave now?
第一次跳伞感觉如何So, what did you think of your first time skydiving?
说老实话  我宁愿不去想了Honestly, I'd rather not think about it anymore.
我觉得你今天非常勇敢I thought what you did was incredibly brave.
我想现在应该告诉你了Well, I-I suppose now's as good a time as any to tell you that,
我早前可能误导了你um, I may have misled you earlier.
我把"好梦"枪给你的时候You see, when I gave you back the night-night pistol,
我撒了谎  还是重了一盎司I lied -- it's still an ounce off.
我知道I know.
是吗You do?
当然了  毕竟Of course. After all...
我可是格兰特·沃德特工I'm Agent Grant Ward.
我刚刚没带降落伞  就从飞机上跳下去I just jumped out of a plane without a parachute on
救了你的小命and saved your life!
其实不是这样Actually, that's not quite it.
要有更多鼻音It's a bit more nasally than that.
斯凯  你好Hello, Skye.
西蒙斯怎么样了How was Simmons?
活蹦乱跳Amazingly resilient.
几乎看不出她差点死掉了You'd never know she almost died.
像这样的经历  需要点时间才能反过劲来Experience like that -- it takes awhile to sink in.
那是她的医检报告吗That her medical report?
其实是我的  血检结果出来了Mine, actually. Blood work finally came back.
我一切如常  血铁含量稍超标I'm perfectly normal -- little heavy on the iron.
但不用担心But don't worry --
你不用叫我钢铁侠You don't have to start calling me "Iron Man."
没那打算Wasn't planning on it.
我的医生并没要我做任何检查My doctors never requested any tests.
是我自己要求的  但是  你已经知道了I ordered them for myself, but you knew that.
这张...This
纸告诉我一切没事piece of paper is telling me that everything's fine,
但是but...
我觉得有事I don't feel fine.
我觉得不一样了I feel different.
脱掉衬衫Take off your shirt.
什么Excuse me?
你的衬衫Your shirt...
解开纽扣unbutton it.
不管是8秒还是40秒  你都死过一次了Whether it was 8 seconds or 40, you died.
人不可能经历那种创伤There's no way you can go through a trauma like that
还毫无改变and not come out of it changed.
你知道我花了多长时间...You know how long it's taken me to --
我知道I know.
这些伤疤的意义在于提醒我们...The point of these things is to remind us that...
已经回不去了there is no going back --
只能继续前行There's only moving forward.
你觉得不一样You feel different...
因为你的确不一样了because you are different.
-我本来打算跳的  -我知道- And I was going to do it. - I know you were.
我拿到了抗血清  降落伞  都齐了I had the antiserum, the chute -- everything.
我只是系不上带子I just couldn't get the straps on.
菲兹  拜托Fitz, please.
也许我是做不到And, you know, maybe I couldn't have done
"空中飞人詹姆斯·邦德"那套the whole "James Bond in midair" type of thing.
菲兹  别说了  拜托Fitz, shut up. Please, just...
沃德做了一件很棒的事  没错Ward did an amazing thing, yes,
但在实验室里陪着我找解药的并不是沃德but it wasn't Ward by my side in that lab, searching for a cure.
我感到绝望时  也不是沃德给了我希望It wasn't Ward giving me hope when I had none.
是你It was you.
你才是英雄You're the hero.
是吗Yeah?
是啊Yeah.
谢谢你Thank you.
《神盾局特工》马上回来We'll be back in a moment.
沙箱  地点:保密
布莱克Blake.
科尔森Coulson.
你就只能编出这种烂理由吗That's the best you could come up with --
"信号不好""We've got a bad connection"?
-当时时间紧迫  -真够大胆的- I was pressed for time. - It's a bold move.
你知道我们的谈话可不是保密的You know our chat wasn't exactly private.
一直如此They never are.
我不知道你在纽约经历了什么I don't know what happened to you in New York,
不知你是真的死了if you really flatlined
还是说达到七级权限  就会得到这副说辞or if that's just what they tell us when we reach level seven,
但无论发生了什么but whatever did happen
你都无权违抗总部的直接命令doesn't give you license to disobey a direct order from HQ.
你继续玩这种把戏You keep pulling stunts like that,
有人或许会夺走你的梦之队someone might decide to take this little dream team away from you.
那就让他们试试I'd like to see them try.
这口气可不像我以前认识的菲尔·科尔森That doesn't sound like the Phil Coulson I used to know.
是啊  的确不像No, I suppose it doesn't.
慢慢习惯吧Get used to it.
