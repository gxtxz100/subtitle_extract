漫威《神盾局特工》前情回顾Previously on "Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."...
神盾局为何要对你隐瞒你死亡的信息呢Why would S.H.I.E.L.D. keep details of your death from you?
塔希提岛上发生了什么事What happened in Tahiti?
弗瑞局长Director Fury
他让一队科学家日以继夜地工作He had a team of scientists working around the clock.
我是想死的I wanted to die.
我们也该让你死And we should have let you.
抓到奎恩后Once we capture Quinn,
就离千里眼又近了一步we'll be one step closer to the Clairvoyant.
斯凯在哪Where's Skye?
科尔森特工  你总这样Agent Coulson, it's dangerous...
让她一个人冲锋陷阵也太危险了sending her in like that, all alone.
天啊  坚持住Oh, god. Hang on.
把她放进去Put her in there!
管用吗Is it working?!
我们得尽快送她去医疗机构We need to get her to a medical facility and fast.
她大约两小时前腹部近距离中了两枪She was shot twice in the abdomen at close range almost two hours ago.
她心跳过速  血压很低She's tachycardic, hypotensive,
且大量失血and lost a significant amount of blood.
为了把她转移过来  我们降低了她的体核温度We had to lower her core body temp in order to transport her here.
或许多亏了这个她才撑到现在It's probably what kept her alive this long.
我们会尽力的We'll do everything we can.
天啊  我真是一团乱Oh, dear. I'm a mess.
不No.
你表现很棒You were great.
插管  把上衣剪下来Intubate, and let's start getting that shirt off.
给Here.
擦掉Mop it off.
好的  注射100毫升Good. 100ccs.
给她做开腹探查术术前准备Okay, let's prep her for ex-lap.
准备好了All set.
病人准备好了  医生Patient's ready, doctor.
我在I'm here.
不行That's unacceptable.
我要直接与弗瑞局长通话  拜托了I need to speak to Director Fury immediately, please.
我怎么没拦着她呢Why didn't I stop her?
我本该拦住她的I could have.
斯凯打定主意要做什么  谁也拦不住As if you could stop Skye doing anything she's set her mind to.
我不该让她一个人去抓奎恩的I shouldn't have let her go after Quinn by herself.
-我在想什么啊  -不是你的错- What was I thinking? - It's not your fault.
她就不该去那儿She shouldn't have been there.
我是她的监管人员  是我的错I'm her S.O. It's on me.
要怪也该怪开枪的人  伊恩·奎恩The one to blame is the man who shot her, Ian Quinn.
他才是罪魁祸首He's responsible.
是的  我的留言是"我的特工要死了Yes, the message is, I have an agent dying,
有些问题只有他才能回答"and there are questions only he can answer.
瑞士  苏黎世  神盾局外伤治疗中心
她怎么样How is she?
不太好Not good.
子弹打穿了她的胃The shots perforated her stomach
并击穿了大肠和小肠and penetrated the large and small intestines.
我们尽可能地切除了  但We resected what we could, but...
损伤太严重There's been too much damage.
下一步怎么办So what's next?
我们尽量让她好受一些We can keep her comfortable,
但你得决定but you'll need to make a decision
是否要靠机器维持她的生命on whether or not you want to keep her on life support.
你是说没别的办法了吗You're saying there's nothing to be done?
我是说你该通知她家人I'm saying you need to call her family
让他们赶紧过来and get them here as soon as possible.
我们就是她的家人We're her family.
那样的话  我很遗憾In that case, I'm very sorry.
终于来人了Finally.
我还以为你们把我忘...I was beginning to think you'd forgotten --
等等Wait!
等等  你不能这样Wait! You can't!
为什么不能Why?
因为你无法还击'cause you're defenseless,
就像她一样吗like she was?
梅  梅May! May!
到外面去Outside, now.
应该死的是他  不是她He deserves to die, not her.
同意Agreed.
但现在  奎恩不重要But right now, Quinn doesn't matter --
斯凯是我们的头等大事  我需要你驾驶飞机Only Skye does, and I need you to pilot the plane.
你听到医生说什么了You heard what the doctor said.
她说他们束手无策She said there was nothing more they could do for her,
但曾有医生让我死而复生but there are doctors who brought me back from the dead.
如果他们这都能做到  就一定能救活斯凯If they can do that, I'm betting they can save skye.
总部来了命令H.Q. radioed in.
让我们把奎恩转移去冷藏库They've ordered us to hand over quinn for interrogation
交给他们审讯and transport to the Fridge.
要我去安排转移吗Do you want me to arrange the transfer?
不No.
我不发话  奎恩就关在我们这儿Quinn stays in our custody until I say otherwise.
是  长官Yes, sir.
你确定要这么做吗Are you sure about this,
带她一路飞去贝塞斯达taking her all the way to Bethesda?
档案里写着那是纽约之战后我接受治疗的地方It's where my file says I was treated after New York.
我明白  但你为什么认为I understand, but what makes you think
那里的医生能想到别的办法呢the doctors there will be able to do anything different?
我知道他们救了你...I know they saved you, but --
他们不只是救了我They did a lot more than save me.
该告诉你们真相了It's time that you know the truth.
那不可能That can't be.
你所说的这种情况What you're describing --
在医学上是不可能的it's medically impossible.
但事实是我现在就站在这里Except for the fact that I'm standing here --
证明了那并非不可能proof that it's not impossible.
这里是更多的证据And here's more proof --
我的档案  描述了他们是如何把我救活的My file, describing how they brought me back --
医生  手术程序  用药The doctors, the procedures, the drugs.
机密  十级权限
长官Sir...
我们看这些文件是违法的  真要这么做吗it's against the law for us to read this. Are you sure?
我不管你们是几级权限I don't care about your clearance level.
我命令你们读这些档案I'm ordering you to read it.
死亡及恢复报告"Death and recovery report."
直到最近  弗瑞局长才允许我查阅这份文件It's only recently that Director Fury gave me access to this.
我看了很多遍了I've gone over it dozens of times.
我需要你们解读我不懂的那些医学内容I need you to decipher the medical parts of it I didn't understand.
有问题的话可以求助斯特莱顿医生Feel free to reach out to Dr. Streiten.
他应该很乐意解答你们的问题He should be eager to answer any questions you may have.
是的  我肯定会有不少问题Yes, I'm sure I'll have quite a few.
那塔希提是怎么回事So, what about Tahiti?
看来那里并不怎么神奇Turns out, not so magical,
只是为了掩盖治疗过程而被植入的记忆just false memories implanted to cover up what was done.
长官Sir...
这里写着你的心脏被刺穿了it says here your heart was perforated,
裂成了两半torn in half.
那部分我明白That part of it I understood.
但他们还是成功使损坏的组织完全痊愈了And yet, they managed to heal the damaged tissue completely.
我们需要知道方法We need to understand how.
好如法炮制地救斯凯So we can do the same for Skye.
我就指望这个呢That's what I'm counting on.
-我们马上开工  -谢谢- We'll get right on it, sir. - Thank you.
疼吗Hurt much?
我没事I'm fine.
科尔森告诉了我他到底死了多久Coulson told me how long he was dead.
但你已经知道了  是吧But you already knew that, didn't you?
我看见斯凯...I saw skye...
躺在医疗舱里in the pod,
机器在过滤她的血machines filtering her blood,
替她维持呼吸breathing for her.
我不知道我会不会这么做I'm not sure I'd make this play --
飞跃半个地球寻求第二次奇迹fly halfway around the world hoping for a second miracle.
如果科尔森认为有百万分之一的机会能救斯凯If Coulson thinks there's a chance in a million to save Skye,
或者我们任何一个人  他都会那么做to save any of us, he'd take it.
我们这样的人People like us --
需要他那样的人we need people like him.
所以这很合理So, yeah, it makes sense --
比另一种选择合理多了a lot more sense than the alternative.
你是说放弃吗You mean giving up?
或者杀了罪魁祸首Or killing the man responsible.
我倒很喜欢看你对奎恩下手I did like seeing you go after Quinn.
你很少这么表露感情You don't open the blinds like that very often.
神盾616号  这里是MT塔台S.H.I.E.L.D. 616, this is tower Michael Tango.
你们违反了神盾局1297号条例You are in violation of S.H.I.E.L.D. directive 1297.
收到请马上回复Respond immediately.
直接抗命Disobeying a direct order.
我们没把奎恩移交审讯We didn't hand Quinn over for interrogation.
好极了Great.
这里是神盾616号  接下来的指令是什么This is S.H.I.E.L.D. 616. How do we proceed?
等待相关人员登机并移交控制权Prepare to be boarded and relinquish command.
来这套Really?
世界上那么多战争混乱All the war and chaos in the world,
神盾局却派了架飞机来追我们and S.H.I.E.L.D. sends a plane after us?
是三架  一架小型运输机用来登机Three planes -- a small transport to dock
两架F35确保我们交出奎恩and a pair of F-35s to make sure we hand over Quinn.
他们要是刮花我的油漆  我会很生气If they scratched my paint, I'm gonna be pissed.
我等你命令  长官I'll await your orders, sir.
加勒特Garrett?
你来这里干什么What the hell are you doing here?
跟我面前这位八级权限的混蛋不同Well, as opposed to the level 8 jackass I'm staring at,
我还知道遵守命令I still follow orders.
你最不擅长的就是遵守命令You're the worst at following orders.
也许吧Maybe...
但我喜欢这个命令but I like this one.
你得马上交出伊恩·奎恩You are to immediately turn Ian Quinn over
让我们转移他去冷藏库for transport to the Fridge.
安托万·崔普利特特工Agent Antoine Triplett,
这位是菲利普·科尔森特工Agent Phillip Coulson.
光看外表不太像  不过You wouldn't know it to look at him, but ...
菲尔是我们最出色的特工之一Phil's one of our finest.
很荣幸  长官An honor, sir.
沃德跟了你后  崔普做了我的行动专家Trip joined me as my specialist after Ward came to your circus.
去接手犯人吧Go secure the prisoner.
遵命  长官Yes, sir.
菲尔  得了Phil, come on.
这架漂亮的飞机虽是弗瑞给你的Just because Fury gave you this pretty plane
他们照样会把它从天上打下来doesn't mean they won't shoot it out of the sky.
你来这里的真正目的是什么  加勒特Why are you really here, Garrett?
神盾局可以随便派一个押解队来接走奎恩S.H.I.E.L.D. could have sent any security team to collect Quinn.
为什么派你来Why you?
你也在追捕他吧You've been chasing him, too.
自马耳他之后Since Malta.
而昨天  你们在意大利闹的那出Then yesterday, your little Italian job
害我们几周的功夫都白费了cost my team weeks of work.
你还不能带他走You can't have him, not yet.
这不是在请求你This isn't a request.
奎恩射伤了我的一个特工Quinn shot one of my agents.
她正在楼下的医疗舱里  靠机器维持生命She's on life support in a med pod downstairs.
我们要送她去贝塞斯达的外伤治疗中心We are taking her to the trauma center in Bethesda.
是奎恩开的枪吗Quinn actually pulled the trigger?
斯凯曾潜入了他在马耳他的大院Skye infiltrated his compound in Malta.
他昨天遇到她时  看来对那事还很记仇When he saw her yesterday, seems he took it personally.
我一直没觉得他会亲自下手I never took him for a triggerman.
他总是买凶杀人He pays others for that.
为了追捕他  我失去了三个手下I've lost three of my own chasing him.
那你就能理解  我救活我的特工之前Then you understand why I can't give him to you
不能把他交给你until we save my agent.
因为如果她没撑过去的话...Because if she doesn't make it...
格兰特·沃德特工Agent Grant Ward.
崔普Trip.
-加勒特在楼上吗  -没错- Is Garrett upstairs? - Yeah.
他还会常提起You know, he still talks about
你那次在万隆千码开外的一枪that thousand-yard shot you took in Bandung.
是两千码It was 2,000.
你来这儿干什么So, what are you doing here?
这简直像是花花公子私人飞机啊Man, this is like the playboy jet.
在这儿能睡到软绵绵的床啊I mean, a guy could get soft bunking in a space like this.
科尔森怎么搞到这么好的飞机的How did Coulson swing such a sweet ride?
他死了一次He died.
那我无话可说了That's tight.
可以带我去你们关押奎恩的房间吗You want to point me to the box you're keeping Quinn?
总部命令加勒特带他去冷藏库进行审讯H.Q. ordered Garrett to haul his ass to the Fridge for questioning.
那是吧台吗Is that a full bar?
自便吧You're welcome to it.
但是  科尔森发话前奎恩不能交给你们But, uh, Quinn stays put till Coulson says otherwise.
得了  哥们Come on, man.
加勒特也做过你的监管人员Garrett was your S.O., too,
你该了解这种情况so you know how this works.
你提醒我一下吧Why don't you remind me?
加勒特要带走奎恩Garrett wants Quinn.
我的职责就是让加勒特得到他想要的It's my job to make sure Garrett gets what he wants.
他在哪Now where is he?
我帮不了你Can't help you with that.
没事No worries.
我自己去找奎恩I'll find Quinn myself.
他肯定被关在"按摩缸"和"壁球室"之间I'm sure he's tucked between the jacuzzi and the squash court.
沃德特工  退下Agent Ward, stand down.
加勒特特工和我达成了共识Agent Garrett and I have come to an agreement.
他说服总部让他在我们飞机上审问奎恩He convinced H.Q. he could interrogate Quinn here on our plane
让我们继续飞往贝塞斯达as we continue to Bethesda.
必要的时候  我还是很会说话的Well, I'm a bit of a sweet talker when I need to be.
你都想不到我当年都让这臭小子做过什么You wouldn't believe what I could talk this son of a gun into.
很高兴见到你  小子Good seeing you, son.
我也是  长官You, too, sir.
谢谢你帮忙And thank you.
救那个女孩要紧Saving the girl's top priority,
她或许知道些什么and she might know something.
他们给科尔森用的药有一半我都没听过I've never heard of half the drugs they gave coulson --
GH325GH-325?
还有他们用来植入塔希提岛记忆的And what about this robotic-assisted-neural-micro-surgery
机械辅助神经微创手术they used to implant the Tahiti memories?
听上去太凶残了It all sounds so diabolical.
是啊I agree.
但事实就摆在面前  他还能跑能跳We can't argue with the results. He's walking around.
是啊  但付出了什么代价呢Yeah, but at what cost?
你也看了副本You read the transcripts.
他恳求医生让他死He begged the doctors to let him die.
这不一样  斯凯还活着This is different. Skye's still alive.
我们要让她活下去We have to keep her that way.
我请求斯特莱顿医生提供些建议来着I've asked Dr. Streiten to advise us.
你好Hello.
没错Yes.
你确定吗Are you sure?
不可能吧That can't be.
我还以为我能扮黑脸呢And here I thought I was gonna get to play bad cop.
伊恩·奎恩  这是加勒特特工Ian Quinn, this is agent Garrett.
他来问你一些问题He's here to ask you some questions.
不用了  谢谢你Oh, no, thank you.
上个访客让我的脑袋一直响到现在I -- my head's still ringing from the last visitor.
至少上个访客还让你留着脑袋了At least the last visitor left you with a head.
我可没那么体贴I'm not always that considerate.
我对你的一个新项目感兴趣I'm interested in one of your newer projects.
但我该从哪个说起呢Hmm? Oh, but there are so many to choose from.
我跟你说清楚Let me be clear --
你没有任何权力you have no rights.
你不能找律师You have no lawyer.
科尔森特工之所以还没把你The only thing keeping agent Coulson here
从飞机上丢下去from throwing you out of this plane
是因为楼下那个年轻的特工还有微弱的心跳is the very weak heartbeat of a young agent downstairs,
我之所以还没把你的舌头揪下来and the only incentive I have for not tearing your tongue out
是因为你还要用它来回答我的问题is that you use it to answer my questions.
你听明白了吗Is that clear?
-你听清他说什么了吗  -没听清- You understand that?  - No.
跟我们说说赛博科技和死亡战士计划Tell us about Cybertek and the Deathlok program.
死亡战士Deathlok?
挺拉风的  是吧Catchy, right?
听起来像是80年代摔跤手的外号Sounds like some wrestler from the '80s.
那到底是什么What is it really?
这事很危险Those are dangerous waters,
上一个调查这事的特工and the last agent that waded into them
腹部中了两枪wound up with two in the stomach.
这么说So...
她还活着是吗she's still alive?
没错  你最好祈祷她能活下去Yeah. And you better hope she stays that way.
你就是为这个对斯凯开枪吗Is that why you shot skye,
因为她看到了赛博科技运来的货物because she saw what cybertek delivered?
不No.
我向斯凯开枪是因为千里眼让我那么做I shot skye because that's what the clairvoyant told me to do.
你们找我吗You wanted to see me?
我刚跟贝塞斯达的创伤治疗中心通了电话I just got off the phone with the trauma center in Bethesda.
斯特莱顿医生消失了Dr. Streiten's gone off the grid.
那就再找一个当时给科尔森做手术的医生呗So we'll find a different doctor there who operated on Coulson.
问题就在这里  事实上That's the thing. Actually...
科尔森根本没在那里接受治疗Coulson was never treated there.
-我不明白  -这一切都让人费解-You're not making sense.  -None of this makes sense.
上面列出的医生名字  手术室号码The doctors listed, the operating-room number --
全都不存在None of them exist.
都不在神盾局名下None of them are part of S.H.I.E.L.D.
真没想到你这样的亿万富翁What I find surprising is how a big-shot billionaire
也会信什么超能力的鬼话could fall for this psychic mumbo jumbo.
一开始我也有所怀疑Oh, I doubted it at the beginning,
但后来我明白这样做对双方都有好处But then I realized it would be mutually beneficial.
他一定掌握了你什么重要的把柄He must have something pretty terrible on you.
居然朝一个手无寸铁的女孩开枪Shooting an unarmed girl?
只能说过去的惨痛教训Let's just say I learned the hard way
让我明白  服从才是最好的选择that obeying was in my best interest.
可你还是成了阶下囚Yet...here you are.
我告诉你  没有什么是巧合Let me assure you it wasn't luck
我能在柏林发现你搭档的黑轿车that led me to your partner's black sedan in Berlin
他会为一名红发女子开门or that he'd open the door for a redhead
还有摩洛哥的那两名特工or those two agents in Morocco.
你认为我手下在那家酒店找到他们Do you think it was just a roll of the dice
真的只是靠运气吗that my people found them in that riad?
不  千里眼看到了一切No, it was the clairvoyant.
那你的千里眼说过我会揍得你满地找牙吗Your clairvoyant say anything about me knocking your teeth in?
千里眼能看到一切The clairvoyant sees everything...
除了他身上发生的事...except what happened to him.
所以这一切还是为了我This is still about me.
等等Wait.
你得跟我说说是怎么回事  菲尔You're gonna need to rewind the tape, Phil.
你听说我在纽约之战前差点死掉的事了吗You heard about my near-death before the battle of New York?
这其中另有内情There's more to it than that.
我以为我只死了几秒I thought I was gone for seconds --
但实际上  是好几天Turns out it was days.
这不可能That's impossible.
所以千里眼会不惜一切查清究竟是怎么回事Which is why the clairvoyant will do anything to know how it happened.
甚至让你对斯凯开枪Even order you to shoot skye.
等等Wait.
你不知道神盾局是怎么救活你的吗You don't know what S.H.I.E.L.D. did to save you.
所以我们正在飞往我接受治疗的地方That's why we're flying to where I was treated.
那么射伤这个女孩迫使你必须去查个明白So shooting the girl forces you to figure it all out.
然后千里眼就能看见事实真相So the clairvoyant can finally see.
或者  你让这个女孩死去Or you let the girl die.
奎恩白白打伤了斯凯Quinn shot Skye for nothing.
我们要去的地方  治疗你的医生The place we were going, the doctors who treated you --
都不存在they don't exist.
或者他们存在于别处呢Or maybe they exist somewhere else.
这可是神盾局  神盾局总有秘密This is S.H.I.E.L.D. There are always secrets.
这正是我担心的  长官That's my fear, sir.
你的文件里全是秘密Your file is filled with secrets --
试验性药物Experimental drugs,
我们闻所未闻的不明手术程序unknown surgical procedures we've never even heard of.
说实话  菲兹和我只弄懂了里面70%的内容Frankly, Fitz and I only understand about 70% of what's in here.
即使我们真找到了你接受治疗的地方Even if we do find where they treated you
并且成功复制了手术流程and we were able to replicate the procedure,
还有一个问题不得不考虑there's the other obvious question.
-是什么  -我们该不该这么做- Which is?  - Whether we should.
你经历的这一切  长官What you experienced, sir,
如果文件里有一丝真实的内容...if this file is even partially accurate --
我不是说要让斯凯也承受No one's suggesting that we submit Skye
我经历过的一切to everything that I went through,
但如果这里面有什么药物but if there's something in here -- a drug,
或是疗法能救她  我们就得找出来a treatment that can save her, we need to find it.
-去弄明白  -遵命  长官- Figure it out.  - Yes, sir.
你不赞同吗You disagree.
没有No.
我也认为应该尽我们一切所能去救斯凯I think we need to do everything humanly possible to save Skye.
但我们也得承认这么做But we need to acknowledge that doing so
可能就正中了千里眼的下怀might give the clairvoyant exactly what he wants.
我们只能冒这个险了It's a risk we have to take.
她怎么样了How is she?
情况还在恶化  我不知该如何阻止Deteriorating, and I don't know how to stop it.
这里面我唯一觉得可能有用的The only thing I've found remotely interesting
是一种叫"GH325"的东西is something called "Gh-325."
是药物吗Some kind of drug?
科尔森特工被注射了这种物质Agent Coulson was injected with that,
几分钟之后and literally minutes later,
他的伤口就开始出现细胞再生his wounds showed signs of cellular regeneration.
再生  有这个可能吗Regeneration? Is that even possible?
就算真有这种神药Even if this miracle drug does exist,
我们也不知道该去哪找we don't know where to find it.
我们没有坐标We have no coordinates,
没有任何进出记录no logs of anyone's departure or arrival.
这方面我或许能帮上忙I think maybe I can help with that.
你弄了个回音室You've set up the echo-chamber.
是  我打了几通电话Yeah, I made a couple of calls.
我的一个哥们在三曲翼总部档案室工作A buddy of mine works in the archives at the Triskelion.
同意让我们在这里查阅Agreed to let us access it from here.
说起来难以置信  但这个方盒子里装着Hard to believe, but this cube contains
神盾局全部历史管理数据all of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s historical administrative data.
好吧  但如果科尔森特工的手术不是在Yeah, but if Agent Coulson's operation didn't take place
神盾局的医疗机构进行的...at a S.H.I.E.L.D. medical facility --
那我们在这里就找不到任何记录  我知道We won't find any record of it here -- I know.
但这里还有全部跨部门备忘录But this also contains all interoffice memos,
行程安排  采购订单travel arrangements, purchase orders.
也许我们可以通过Maybe we can track down the location
哪份虚拟文件追查到具体地点through a virtual paper trail of some sort or another.
嗯Yeah.
好吧Okay.
我们就从科尔森被刺伤那天的Well, let's start with the travel memoranda
行程备忘录开始查吧from the date Coulson got stabbed.
或者从斯特莱顿医生离开三曲翼总部查起Or, um, what about Dr. Streiten's departure from the Triskelion?
-也许有这记录  -好吧- Maybe they have that.  - Yeah.
在这儿Got it.
这里  这个很有意思Here. This is interesting.
二战地堡A World War II Bunker?
"倒塌的"地堡"Collapsed" bunker.
绝对不是神盾局的正式机构Definitely not a sanctioned S.H.I.E.L.D. facility.
招待所
-招待所  -是的- "The Guest House"?  - Exactly.
招待所  GH[首字母缩写]  GH325Guest House -- G.H. GH-325.
看看文件的查阅记录Look at the file's access history.
唯一的查阅记录是The only record of it being opened...
一位十级权限的特工is by a level 10 operative.
-弗瑞局长  -弗瑞局长- Director Fury.  - Director Fury.
那么弗瑞来过这地方  而他就是So, Fury's been to this place, and he's the person
批准给科尔森特工做手术的人who sanctioned the operations on Agent Coulson.
赶快找那份档案啊And why aren't you trying to find the file?
这就找I'll do that.
加密了  斯凯肯定能破解Encrypted. Skye could crack this.
她会怎么做What would she do?
这不是加密It's not an encryption.
招待所不是神盾局的机构The Guest House is not a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility.
我们不知道里面有什么人或什么东西We don't know who or what's in there.
为可能的抵抗做好准备Be prepared for potential resistance.
没跟里面联络上吗No contact from inside?
我试过了所有已知频道  没有回应I've tried every known channel -- no response.
这地方可能被废弃了Place could be abandoned.
希望没有Let's hope not.
我们还需要里面的人救斯凯呢We need the people inside to work on Skye.
一接到通知西蒙斯就能转移斯凯Simmons is prepping Skye to move at a moment's notice, sir.
崔普能帮忙  他受过医学训练Trip can help. He's had med-tech training.
很好  如果做得好  这事可以和平解决Good. We do our jobs right, this will all go peacefully.
如果他们不愿帮我们怎么办What if they don't want to help us?
那我就说"劳您大驾"I'll say "Pretty please."
我们需要医生活着  不能弄坏设施We need the doctors alive and the place intact.
如果出了岔子  菲兹  你得下去If it does go sideways, Fitz, I need you down there
看看有什么西蒙斯能用来救斯凯的东西to determine what Simmons can use to help Skye.
然后都拿走  行动吧And then we take it. Let's move.
有人来了Company?
这几周都没有安排啊Nothing's scheduled for a couple weeks.
对对暗号Try the protocol.
从伊斯坦布尔开车过来还顺利吗How was the drive from Istanbul?
口令Countersign?
不知道No clue.
从来没听过Never heard it.
我在神盾局所有的口令指导中都找不到I can't find it in any of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s protocol directives.
我是神盾局的科尔森特工This is Agent Coulson with S.H.I.E.L.D.
我们不知道口令  但我们有一个成员We don't know the counter, but we have a team member
迫切需要医疗救助in dire need of medical assistance.
我们知道她在这里可以得到治疗  请开门We know she can be treated here. Open the doors.
也许我们可以商量一下  听到了吗Maybe we can work something out. Do you copy?

从伊斯坦布尔开车过来还顺利吗How was the drive from Istanbul?
那就"劳您大驾"吧"Pretty please" it is.
这些人挺厉害啊  闯进来了These guys are good -- hacked their way in.
他们怎么找到这地方的How the hell did they find this place?
无所谓  反正他们不知道口令Doesn't matter. Didn't know the countersign.
-你左还是右  -左吧- You want left of right? - Left's good.
有一个前厅和一组玻璃门There's an antechamber and a set of glass doors.
再过去就看不清了  灯全灭了Can't see much beyond that. Lights are all out.

西蒙斯Simmons?

通讯中断了Comms are down.
我们头顶上的山太厚了There's too much mountain on top of us.
相信我  这样更好Trust me -- it's better.
你也不希望她们听到我们踏进龙潭虎穴吧You don't want them hearing the horrible death we're walking into.
逗你呢  小子Humor, son.
你们英国人就是太严肃You brits are too serious.
再说  如果任务很容易的话Besides, if the job was easy...
那就没意思了It wouldn't be any fun.
我才不怕呢  还没到怕的时候I'm not afraid -- not yet.
我认为我们打开这扇防弹门之后I suspect the real danger won't happen
才会遭遇真正的危险until we breach that bulletproof glass.
可能是通往地面的楼梯井Probably a stairwell back to the surface.
怎么样  菲兹  你能打开门吗What do you think, Fitz? Can you get us inside?
踏进龙潭虎穴吗To certain horrible death?

那你知道...计时器吧Then you know about... the timer.
出麻烦了We got a problem!
塞姆汀塑胶炸药Semtex.
这地方安了炸弹等待引爆The whole place is rigged to blow.
这些炸药都够把上面的山炸下来了There's enough explosive to bring down the whole mountain on top of us.
长官  还有不到10分钟Sir. Less than 10 minutes.
这大概是以防万一It's probably a failsafe.
如果警卫消灭了我们  他们就关闭计时器If the guards had eliminated us, they'd stop the timer.
他们失败了Since they didn't...
这是紧急超驰控制程序It's some kind of emergency override.

没时间搜查整座建筑了There's no time to search the whole compound.
也许我们能拿些炸药  炸开防弹门Maybe we can take some semtex, use it on the doors.
内有生物危害物质

她很坚强The girl's a fighter.
