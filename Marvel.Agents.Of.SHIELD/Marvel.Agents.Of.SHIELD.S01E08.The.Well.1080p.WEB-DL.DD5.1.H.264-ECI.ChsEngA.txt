神盾局特工第一季 第八集By aBu 201705
古时候  人们相信In ancient times, people believed
天堂满是诸神  怪兽和魔法疆域the heavens were filled with gods and monsters and magical worlds.
随着时间推移Then, as time passed,
那些信仰蜕变为神话和传说those beliefs faded into myth and folklore.
但现在我们知道故事是真的But now we know the stories were true.
像阿斯加德这样的世界是存在的Other worlds, with names like Asgard, exist.
托尔这样曾被敬为神祇的人物And beings once revered as gods, like Thor,
回到了地球  留下了更多的疑问have returned, leaving us with more questions and...
和一大堆烂摊子让我们清理An enormous mess to clean up.
别说我没给过你什么Don't say I never gave you anything.
英国  伦敦  格林威治大学
还得逐一检测每块小石头的外星光谱特征Checking for alien spectrographic signatures one teeny rock at a time.
这是必要的预防措施Necessary precaution.
我们可不想让外星物件被坏人拿到We don't want anything alien getting in the wrong hands.
即便如此  这种简单工作连猴子都能做啊Still, this is definitely the type of work a monkey could easily do.
你就是我们的小猴子You're our little monkey.
爸爸妈妈来电
别那样看着我Don't give me that look.
我准备好了  自然会接电话I'll talk to them when I talk to them.
接谁的电话Talk to who?
妈妈和爸爸Mum and dad.
他们想让我解答...They want explanations and answers for...
这些事Well, all this.
但我没法回答他们But I don't have any answers.
更重要的是  我被感染后还没跟他们通过话And, more importantly, I haven't talked to them since I was ill.
要是他们知道了  他们会更担心And if they knew that, they'd be even more terrified.
所以  你懂的...So, you know...
何必浪费时间呢...why waste any of our time, really?
你们已经不以为奇了You guys may think it's old news,
但这对其他人来说绝对是新闻but it's new...news to everybody else.
阿斯加德人是来自另一个星球的外星人So, Asgardians are aliens from another planet
数千年之前曾来过地球that visited us thousands of years ago?
可能要更早Or more.
当时人们不理解什么是外星人And because we couldn't understand aliens,
就以为他们是神we thought they were gods?
北欧神话就是这么诞生的That's where our Norse mythology comes from.
太疯狂了That's too crazy.
你说其他神祇也是外星人吗Do you think other deities are aliens, too?
毗湿奴肯定是  对吧Vishnu for sure, right?
印度教三相神之一
哪怕一次也好You know, it'd be nice if, for once,
真希望托尔和他的手下能把Thor and his people sent down
"收拾自己的烂摊子"神派下来the god of cleaning up after yourself.
他们也许有个魔法扫帚之类的They probably have a magic broom for this kind of thing.
真希望他们能把外星飞船留下I just wish they'd left their alien ship behind.
好让我们把那个也清理掉吗So we can clean that up, too?
好让我们进去  看看里面So we could go inside, take a peek under the hood,
或许兜兜风什么的maybe take it for a spin.
拜托  难道开外星飞船Come on, you're telling me piloting an alien ship
不在你的遗愿清单上吗isn't on your bucket list?
我印象中I can't think of a single time
外星物件落到人类手中从没有好下场when anything alien in human hands ended well.
我倒不介意托尔"落到我手中"Wouldn't mind getting my human hands on Thor.
他真是梦幻般的存在He's so dreamy.
他是挺英俊的  但...Sure, he's handsome, but --
不  他就是梦幻般的存在No. He's dreamy.
菲兹  那是...Fitz, is that, um --
肯定不是这个星球的Definitely not from here.
应该也是飞船的残骸  你在干什么Another piece of the ship. What are you doing?
眼不见...Out of sight...
...心不烦...out of mind.
这才是我们来的目的That's why we're here.
控制局面Keep everything under control.
挪威  特莱马卡国家公园
-谁会干这种事  -谁知道呢- Now, who would do something like that? - Who knows.
宝贝  看Baby, look.
"水之南  山之北""South of the water, north of the hill..."
"一圈石头""...A halo of stones" --
"环绕大树""Protect the tree still."
雅各布  是它吗Jakob, is this it?
我们应该去看看We should check that out.
终于找到了Finally, after all this time.
等不及告诉其他人了I can't wait to tell the others.
我说过这是真的...I told you it was real...
而且我会找到的And that I would find it.
准备好了吗Are you ready?
不要排斥你的感受What you're feeling, don't fight it.
那种愤怒  早已存在于你体内That rage, it's already inside of you.
不要害怕  不要逃避它的力量Don't be afraid of it. Don't hide from its power.
接纳它Embrace it.
接纳它Embrace it!
天呐  你们做了什么God! What have you done?
需要的话我可以去爬I can climb it if you want.
教我怎么用这些...小玩意就行Just talk me through what to do with the...doodads.
也就15英尺[4.6米]高Yeah, it's only about 15 feet.
没事的  我...I'll be fine. I'm --
只是从那次差点摔死之后I'm just a bit more wary about the height thing
我对高度比较敏感since falling to certain death.
你害怕了You're afraid.
吓着了  是吗Shaken up?
很正常It's normal.
但有的感觉就是But some feelings will take over
你越去想越强烈if you dwell on them.
特别是恐惧Especially fear.
好了  一直看前面Now, keep your eyes ahead.
集中想着你最想做的事Focus on what you like to do best.
好的Yep.
不是掉下去Not falling.
不是  是调查No, research.
你是一个科学家  你最喜欢解密You're a scientist. You like to figure things out.
是的  用我的小玩意Yes. With my doodads.
我很好奇I'm curious.
不管这树上有什么Whatever was up in these trees
肯定在里面几世纪了  是吗had to be there for centuries, right?
至少上千年At least a millennium.
放射性碳14检测表明部分树有九千年了Radiocarbon-14 dates some of these trees at 9,000 years old.
不可思议  难道树是包着它生长的吗That sounds impossible. Think the tree grew around it?
我得先查查年轮才能确定I'd have to check the dendrochronology first to know for certain.
但是  挪威云杉是种生长很快的松柏门植物But, I mean, the Norway spruce is a rather fast-growing coniferous,
而且我知道你想骗我再爬高点and I know you're trying to trick me into going up,
但我反正也要往上爬...but I'm going up anyway, so...
如果你掉下来了我会接住你的I'll catch you if you fall.
尖叫着  她眼里充满恨意Screaming, and so much hate in her eyes.
你说她还拿着一根银棒And you said she had a silver stick?
也可能是钢的  我不确定Steel, maybe. I-I don't know.
上面还有图案It, uh, had decorations on it.
你能形容一下或是画下来吗Could you describe or draw them?
我没仔细看  拔腿就跑了I didn't get a good look. I I just ran.
谁会做这么邪恶的事Who would do something so evil?
很遗憾你失去了同事I'm sorry for your loss.
结果:检测到外星物质
这里面的东西Oh, um, whatever was in here
绝不是来自这个世界was definitely not from this world.
菲兹  你收到了吗Fitz, you getting this?
这不是奇塔瑞的  是吧It's not Chitauri, is it?
不不  别担心No, no, no. Don't worry.
这不是病毒威胁This isn't another viral threat.
等一下Um, hang on.
与光谱特征匹配的是...Spectrographic signatures match readings from...
雷神之锤Thor's hammer.
西蒙斯  树里面的东西来自阿斯加德Simmons, whatever was in that tree is Asgardian.
我能看到嵌入物的印记I-I can see an imprint of what was embedded.
三维立体复位扫描Scanning for three-dimensional restoration.
好了告诉我Tell me when.
好了When.
看上去像是根手杖或棒子Um, looks like a staff or a rod.
工艺精良  雕刻完美Well crafted. Engraved.
我转换一下  做个3D模型I'll convert it, print a 3-d model.
这片森林是自然保护区This forest is a protected reserve.
他们以为他们是谁啊I mean, who do they think they are?
还有别的什么细节吗Anything else? Details?
有没有能帮我们找到那些人Anything that might help us to find these people
或是他们藏身处的线索or where they might be hiding?
长官  看来他们没打算藏Sir, doesn't look like they're hiding.

由这一男一女领头was led by this man and woman,
尽管尚不清楚他们的动机and though their motive was unclear,
他们的宣言已经震撼地摆在了奥斯陆街头their message was hauntingly spelled out on the streets of Oslo.
看来我们知道他们以为自己是什么人了Well, I guess we know who they think they are.
我们是神
雅各布·奈斯特姆  30岁Jakob Nystrom, 30.
他女朋友  佩特拉·拉尔森Girlfriend, Petra Larsen.
一个挪威异教仇恨组织的领袖Leaders of a Norse paganist hate group.
拜格林威治的事和互联网所赐And their numbers are growing, thanks to what happened in Greenwich
他们组织的人数还在增长and thanks to the internet.
没错  就是互联网  真讽刺啊Yay, internet, she said sarcastically.
挪威异教徒Norse paganist?
沉迷于一切与挪威神话有关的东西Obsessed with anything derived from norse mythology --
也就是阿斯加德的故事stories of Asgard.
现在我们要对付的是一件武器And now a weapon.
只能扫描到一侧The scan only accounted for one side.
树受的损伤太严重  难以完全复制Too much damage to the tree for complete reproduction.
但你们看  很显然两端都是断的But see here -- it's clearly broken on both ends.
就是说还有其他部分吗So there are more pieces?
对  至少还有两截Yeah. Two at least.
那么这对情侣可能还在找其他几截Which means Sid and Nancy may be looking for a complete set.
雅各布·奈斯特姆  佩特拉·拉尔森
-这是什么图案  -阿斯加德的符号- The markings? - Asgardian symbolism.
仅凭我们有限的知识很难进行翻译Hard to translate with our limited knowledge.
你该把你朋友雷神喊过来You should give your buddy the god of thunder a shout.
他的力量来自他的锤子吧He gets his power from his hammer, right?
或许这是锤子上的钉子呢What if this is his nail to the hammer?
我找过了I already did.
弗瑞局长说找不到他Director Fury told me he's off the grid.
就算他有手机  我们也没他的号码And if he has a cellphone, we don't have the number.
神盾局主要着手寻找S.H.I.E.L.D.'s investigation are on the trail
奈斯特姆和他的信众of Nystrom and his followers.
我们负责辨认出该物件We're charged with identifying the object
并抢先一步找到其他几块and finding any other pieces before they do.
他们似乎有些优势They seem to have some advantage.
他们在150平方公里的挪威森林里They found this thing in 150 square kilometers
找到了这东西of norwegian forest.
各位  或许是它用魔法召唤了他们呢Guys. What if it called to them with magic?
召唤他们吗Called to them.
这是阿斯加德的东西啊We know it's Asgardian,
可能不遵循地球的规律so the rules are a little bendy here.
就算我们尚不理解一样东西Just because we don't understand something yet
也不能就退回中世纪doesn't mean we should regress back to the dark ages,
往魔法和童话上想talking of magic and fairy tales.
其实  我们就要这么做Actually, that's exactly what we're going to do.
-你说什么  -真的吗- Excuse me? - Really?
我们在新墨西哥州找到雷神之锤时When we first found the hammer in New Mexico,
我请教了一位挪威神话方面的世界顶尖专家I consulted one of the world's leading experts on Norse Mythology
埃利奥特·兰道夫Elliot Randolph,
塞维尔一所大学的教授a professor at a university in Seville.
我们这就去找他We'll leave immediately.
或许他能给我们更多关于这些图案的信息Maybe he can tell us more about these markings.
西班牙  塞维尔
得适应改变  埃琳娜Well, one must adapt, Elena.
最近发生的事让我们都措手不及Recent events have thrown us all for a loop.
我一直以为我在教挪威神话I thought I was teaching Norse Mythology.
但事实证明  我是一个历史学教授No, turns out I'm a history professor.
那么  你不打算更改我的分数吗So, you're not going to change my grade?
不  我给你一星期时间重写No. I will give you a week to rewrite it.
总体上I think, in general,
多一点历史描述  少一点评价little more history, less lit crit.
但希望我们今晚还可以共进晚餐But I do hope we're still on for dinner tonight.
我列了一张书单或许有帮助I've included a list of books there that might help you.
再见I'll see you later.
兰道夫教授Professor Randolph.
科尔森特工  快请进Agent coulson. Come in, come in.
沃特菲尔德44钢笔Waterfield 44.
14k金的笔尖嵌上珍珠母14-karat-gold nib with mother-of-pearl inlay.
你挺有眼光的嘛That's quite an eye you've got.
我不知道你还是个收藏家I didn't know you were a collector.
领公务员的工资  哪收藏得起On a government salary, not quite.
我猜你们是在伦敦找到了什么Well, I'm assuming you found something on the ground in London.
是在挪威的一棵树里In a tree in Norway.
不幸的是And, unfortunately,
不是我们找到的we weren't the ones who found it.
这是个3D模型It's a 3-D model.
太不可思议了Oh, that is amazing.
从这些如尼文来看Now, based on these runes,
这应该是狂暴战士手杖的一截I'd say I'm looking at a piece of the berserker staff.
我们来看一看Let's have a look.
没错  这段神话要追溯到12世纪晚期Yeah, the myth dates back to the late 12th century.
是关于一名来自阿斯加德的强大战士It's all about a powerful warrior from Asgard.
这里Here.
一名狂暴战士军队的士兵A soldier in the berserker army.
狂暴战士军队Berserker army?
是的Oh, yeah.
一支强大的军队A powerful army.
势不可挡Fierce army it was.
狂暴战士像愤怒的野兽一样战斗Berserkers battled like raging beasts,
所到之处  片甲不留destroying everything in their path.
一名狂暴战士拥有20名战士的力量A single berserker had the strength of 20 warriors.
那么持手杖者能拥有超人类的力量喽So whoever wielded the staff got superhuman strength?
用它战斗的战士将Fighting with it put the warrior
处于一种无法控制的愤怒中into a state of uncontrollable rage.
手杖有一种非常强大的魔法The staff contained a very powerful magic.
或是我们还未发现的科学特性Or a scientific attribute we've yet to discover.
头脑聪明还笑靥如花Analytically minded and pretty as a peach.
传说中的战士呢The warrior in the story.
根据传说  他来到地球是为了战斗Well, in the story, he came to earth to fight,
结果却坠入了爱河but he ended up falling in love.
爱上了谁With whom?
爱上了地球上的生活With life on earth.
爱上了人类Humanity.
他爱得如此深切He fell so much in love
他的军队返回阿斯加德时that when his army returned to Asgard,
他选择了留下he stayed behind.
那手杖呢What happened to the staff?
他不想让它的黑魔法落入歹人手中Well, he didn't want its dark magic falling into the wrong hands,
于是把手杖断成三截so he broke it into three pieces
每一截藏在了不同的地方and hid each one in a different location.
手稿上有没有说他把它们藏在了哪The manuscript wouldn't happen to say where he hid them, would it?
实际上  有说Actually, it does.
在三首诗里In three verses.
而且要知道  这都是从失传已久的古文字中Now, let's all bear in mind these are poetic abstracts
诗意概括来的from long-lost ancient texts.
有一首是关于树So, there is one about a tree,
看来他们已经找到了which they've found, it seems.
另一首  "河流以东  烈日当空Another is, "East of the river, sun overhead,
埋于土中  毗邻遗骨"buried in earth with the bones of the dead."
有点毛骨悚然  不是吗That's a bit macabre, isn't it?
还有一首There's another here.
这首连韵脚都没有Well, this one doesn't even have a rhyme.
主要意思是  "靠近上帝"But the gist of it is "Close to god."
那可以是指任何东西  不是吗That could be anything, couldn't it?
也可能什么都不是It could also mean nothing.
没想到还要猜谜I was hoping for less metaphor,
我还希望能直接是坐标呢more longitude and latitude.
沿着维京海盗袭击路线搜寻Well, I mean, it does stand to reason to search
比较合理  不是吗near Viking raid routes, doesn't it?
近来  加拿大沿海的巴芬岛Now, there have been some recent interesting findings
发现了一些有趣的挪威遗迹of Norse relics on Baffin Island off the coast of Canada.
可谓史前古器物中的无价之宝Yeah, virtual treasure trove of new artifacts.
那么我们就从那里入手  谢谢你  教授We'll start there, then. Thank you, professor.
你知道巴芬岛上有一座托尔峰吗Did you know there's Mount Thor on Baffin Island?
不知道I did not.
你知道托尔峰上没有什么吗Do you know what's not on Mount Thor?
跟阿斯加德的半点联系Anything Asgardian at all.
我们在那边的特工什么都没找到Our agents on the ground haven't found a thing.
你这里怎么样What about you?
奈斯特姆暗网的留言板上净是一群疯子Nystrom's deep-web message boards are just abuzz with psychos.
他们坚信自己将升仙They believe they're gonna ascend
成为死亡与毁灭之神to be the gods of destruction and death.
都是些鸟人  长官People suck, sir.
这就是你的进展吗  "都是些鸟人"That's your progress? "People suck"?
这些人确实很烂These people do.
另外他们还在谈论转入地下And there's also chatter about going underground.
可能是指隐姓埋名或者...Could mean going incognito or...
或者寻找手杖的下一截Or searching for the next piece.
兰道夫建议沿维京人的路线搜索Randolph said to check viking routes.
还要其它的吗Find any others?
俄罗斯境内伏尔加河沿岸有些遗迹There's some sites along the Volga River in Russia,
基辅也有一些  奇怪的是  这里也有Some in Kiev, and, weirdly, here.
塞维尔
在西班牙的塞维尔吗In Seville, Spain?
可能性比较小It's a long shot,
但维京人曾两次洗劫塞维尔but vikings sacked Seville twice.
我们找到一个有维京遗迹的可能地点We found one promising location with viking relics --
艾尔德维诺尼诺El Divino Nino.
一个建在8世纪地穴废墟上的教堂A church built on the ruins of an 8th-century crypt
而那之前  是公元前206年的罗马遗址built on Roman ruins from 206 B.C.
河流以东East of a river.
还有许多遗骨And lots of bones.
看看我们能找到[挖出]点什么Let's see what we can dig up.
听懂我的双关语了吗See what I did there?
这感觉一定不错Must be nice --
有强制午休时间have a mandatory nap time.
午休不是强制的Siesta isn't mandatory.
气候炎热国家如西班牙等有午睡的习惯
但午睡确实是件美事Just very pleasant.
你怎么样  沃德特工How you doing, Agent Ward?
真希望我没长这么高Wishing I was shorter.
暂时还没有发现Nothing yet.

仪器读数一切正常All my readings are normal.
你呢  斯凯  运气如何What about you, Skye? Any luck?
幸运的是我的监管人员I'm lucky my S.O.
主动提出搜索阴森恐怖的走道volunteered to take the super-creepy hallway
而把这间好不到哪去的地牢留给了我instead of the slightly less-creepy dungeon-room place.
我没有发现I got nothing.
抱歉  啥都没有Sorry -- nada.
沃德  你的光谱仪检测到周围有异常Ward, your spectrograph is reading something near you.
我什么都没看见I don't see anything.
仪器显示就在你正前方Well, it's right in front of you.
等等...不对  好吧...稍等Oh, wait. No. Uh, okay, hold on.
它正在移动  西北方向It's moving. Northwest.
我看到可疑人物了Visual contact.
沃德  向左转Ok Ward, turn left.
我可以解释这一切I have a wonderful explanation.
我遇到了意想不到的...Ran into some unexpected com--
沃德  发生了什么事Ward, what's happening?
他的仪器刚刚失去了联系His device just went down.
-斯凯  你能...  -已经在路上了- Skye, can you get... - Already on it.
沃德Ward.
你还好吗Are you all right?
格兰特  冷静点  求你了Grant, calm down. Calm down, please.
冷静下来Calm down.
手杖...被他拿走了The staff -- he has it.
沃德有点不对劲Something's wrong with Ward.
手杖也不见了  被人拿走了The staff's gone. Someone took it.
我也有一截I have one, too.
他不会就这么凭空消失的He can't just disappear.
他总会在哪...He'll have to turn up some...
出现...where.
出现了There we go.
教堂南一街区处A block south of the church.
教授Professor.
我搞砸了I screwed up.
-这么做真没必要  -很有必要- This is ridiculous. - It's anything but.
沃德  你刚刚昏过去了Ward, you passed out.
而且你的举止很不对劲And you were acting not right.
科尔森命令我给你做一个全面检查Coulson ordered me to give you a full work-up,
我要听他的命令and that's exactly what I'm doing.
在你失去知觉前Um, before you lost consciousness,
你有没有幽闭恐惧的感觉were you feeling claustrophobic?
为什么这么问Why?
她是在排除恐惧发作的可能性She's ruling out a panic attack.
我从不恐惧  从来不会I don't panic. Ever.
好的  排除了There we go. Ruled out.
你是触碰了手杖才这样的  是吗Touching the staff caused it, right?
有任何遗留症状吗Any residual effects?
你是否觉得自己有异于寻常的力量Are you exhibiting any extra s-strength?
让我拿那家伙试试吧Why don't I find out on that guy?
还是别了吧Why don't we not do that?
你昏迷之前记得的最后一件事是什么What's the last thing you remember before you lost consciousness?
这简直是浪费时间This is a waste of time.
我们得尽快找到手杖We need to find the staff.
你到底记得什么What exactly do you remember?
一件我很久没想过的事Something I hadn't thought about in a long time.
我们还是别问了Why don't we leave it alone?
他刚把手臂抽出来了...Well, I mean, he just pulled his arm out of this --
安静Quiet!
我想听他说什么I want to hear this.
我的手下受伤了  手杖不见了One of my men is hurt. The staff is gone.
我也不想那样I didn't want any of that to happen.
那你想怎样What did you want?
独享手杖的力量吗The staff's power for yourself?
根本不是那样Nothing like that.
我只想做第一个研究它的人You know, I just wanted to be the first to study it,
证明狂暴战士真的来过这里to prove that the Berserkers were actually here,
是历史的一部分a part of history.
你想想看吧You think about that.
我在想呢Oh, I'm thinking about it.
你在干什么What are you doing?
你的心率在上升  肾上腺素分泌激增Your heart rate's rising. Adrenaline's spiking.
你需要冷静下来  不能情绪激动You need to calm down, not get worked up.
那段回忆  是关于你弟弟的吗The memory -- was it about your brother?
别问了Drop it.
沃德  如果你需要宣泄  有我呢  我可以...Ward, if you need to get it out, I am here --
谈谈吗Right. To talk.
因为你就只会那个  废话连篇Because that's what you do -- talk...and talk.
你不会对自己的声音感到厌烦吗Don't you ever get tired of hearing your own voice?
沃德  别这样Ward, stop.
这就说得通了Well! This makes more sense.
沃德  你现在体验到的这种感觉Ward, what you're experiencing, this feeling --
是一种化学反应it's chemistry.
希望如此Hope so.
是的  他的促肾上腺皮质激素激增Yeah, spikes in his adrenocorticotropic hormone.
就像听人家说It's like those stories you hear
妈妈为了救自己的孩子抬起了一辆车when a mother is able to lift a car to save her baby.
肾上腺素激增可以产生巨大的...An adrenaline surge can create a massive --
别说了Stop talking!
想办法Just fix it!
我也希望我能I wish I could.
我们可以减轻部分症状We can relieve some of the symptoms.
我会给你注射10毫升的苯二氮I'm going to give you 10cc of benzodiazepine.
冷静药  好主意Chill pill. Good idea.
镇静剂  不行A sedative? Not gonna happen.
讲讲道理  看看你现在的样子Yeah, well, be reasonable. Look how you're behaving.
给我注射了镇静剂And if I'm sedated
要是碰上那群"嗨翻"的疯子and we cross paths with those juiced freaks,
那群掀翻车子  把人压扁的家伙the ones who flip cars and smash people up,
你要去对付他们are you gonna take them on?
保护我们吗Keep us safe?
还是要我再救西蒙斯一次Or am I gonna have to save Simmons' ass...again?
那只是生物化学反应That was just a biochemical reaction.
他不是真心的He didn't mean all that.
我懂No, I know.
不用解释No explanation necessary.
-他们怎么找到它的  -我怎么知道- How'd they find it? - I have no idea how they found it.
他们也许有原始文本They may have the original texts.
跟我没关系I wasn't involved.
这只是一个发掘神从天堂You know, it was just a chance to uncover something
带来的东西的机会that the gods brought down from the heavens.
那是外星人带来的  从外太空Aliens brought it. From space.
我曾经和外星人独处过I've spent some one-on-one time with aliens before.
结果不太好Didn't work out too well.
所以对这类案件  我很敏感So cases like this are personal to me.
我只知道这些That's all I know.
好好待着吧Get comfortable.
救命Help me!
求你了  救救我Please! Help me!
救命Help me!
沃德Ward!
沃德Hey, Ward!
你应该小心点You should be more careful.
我没事  你呢I'm fine. You?
我在解决呢I'm working it out.
你在砸东西泄愤You're punching things.
这是你最不该做的了The last thing you need is to punch things.
你有更好的办法吗You got a better idea?
让我帮你吧Let me help you.
我唯一需要的帮助The only help I need
是在那些人再伤人之前阻止他们is to stop those guys before they hurt somebody else.
我们是新秩序We are the new order!
我们的世界正在被神祇夺走Our world is being taken by gods!
我们将要成为神  把它夺回来We will become gods and take it back!
这就是新秩序This is the new order!
你们准备好夺回权力了吗Are you ready to take back the power?
能说句话吗  长官A moment, sir?
进来吧Come on in.
我担心之前与武器的接触I'm concerned that my exposure to that weapon
已经影响了我的工作能力has compromised my ability to do my job.
继续说Go on.
你知道我的家史You're familiar with my family history.
所以很显然  我不会回想自己的童年So, for obvious reasons, I don't think back to childhood.
从不Ever.
有些记忆早已被我尘封There are things I put away a long time ago.
封得严严实实On lockdown.
因为要做好现在的工作  我必须专注  机敏Because to do this, I have to be focused, tactical.
我不能分心I can't be distracted.
尤其不能为很久以前发生的事分心Especially by things that happened a lifetime ago.
你是说触摸手杖唤醒了一些记忆You're saying touching the staff unlocked certain memories.
最痛苦的记忆My worst memory.
我第一次感觉到...The first time I felt...
恨hate.
那感觉挥之不去And it won't go away.
我不信任我自己I don't trust myself.
我在实验室对斯凯和菲兹-西蒙斯发火...The way I went off at Skye and Fitz-Simmons in the lab --
格兰特  你告诉我这些Grant... you telling me this
让我觉得我可以信任你makes me feel I can trust you.
可是他...Him, on the other hand...
我无法让教授开口I can't get the professor to talk.
你不是积压了些愤怒吗You've got some rage built up.
或许该发泄一下了Maybe it's time to let it out.
你得开口说实话You need to start talking.
我把我知道的都告诉科尔森特工了I told Agent Coulson everything I know.
你在撒谎You're lying.
告诉我那玩意对我做了什么Tell me what that thing did to me
我怎样才能恢复and how fix it.
我发誓我真的不知道I swear I don't know.
那好吧Okay, then.
你说得对You were right.
他是阿斯加德人He's Asgardian.
幸好Good thing.
否则就太尴尬了Otherwise, that would have been awfully embarrassing.
好吧  我很想知道Okay, I have to know.
你是怎么发现的How did you figure me out?
推理Did the math.
一  你不是我抓住的第一个阿斯加德人One -- you're not the first Asgardian I've had in custody.
你们被抓后不感到畏惧或慌张You guys don't flinch or panic in captivity.
二  沃特菲尔德44钢笔Two -- a Waterfield 44?
就凭文学教授的那点工资On a lit professor's salary?
怎么能买得起I don't think so.
最后And lastly,
我说起我曾跟外星人独处过时when I tell someone I've had some one-on-one time with an alien,
一般人会比较好奇they tend to be a little curious.
你绝对比一般人更具洞察力  科尔森特工Well, you're certainly more observant than most, Agent Coulson.
你就是那个留下的阿斯加德战士吧So, you're the Asgardian warrior who stayed.
不要跟别人说  拜托了Please don't tell anyone.
真没想到啊I had no clue.
你呢Did you?
就在光天化日之下  一个真正的阿斯加德人Hidden in plain sight -- an actual Asgardian.
太厉害了Brilliant.
你们说他在地球上待了多久了How long do you suppose he's been on our planet?
一千年  可能更久A thousand years. Maybe more.
如果我们能给他稍稍开个刀If we could just cut him open a little bit,
提取些组织样本  或是体液get some tissue samples, maybe some bodily fluids,
就可以确定了we could find out.
也可以直接问他啊  你个怪人Or we could just ask him, weirdo.
这可比看历史频道过瘾多了This is way, way better than the history channel.
这家伙经历过所有恐怖的事件I mean, this guy has lived through all the scary stuff --
十字军东征  黑死病  迪斯科the Crusades, the Black Death, disco.
你干什么呢What are you doing?
封闭审讯室的门Sealing the interrogation-room door.
科尔森的命令Coulson's orders.
要把我关起来啊Ah, locking me in.
更小的牢房我都待过Well, I've been in tighter spots.
这间屋子是由镀碳化硅汎合金打造的This room is made of a silicon carbide-coated vibranium alloy.
美队圆盾材料
专门用来关你这种人Meant for prisoners like yourself.
但你也在这里面But you're in here, too.
那扇门终归还是得打开And eventually, somebody will open that door.
我让他们开才会开Not if I tell them not to.
这么说  神话就是你的自传So, the myth is your autobiography.
不是我写的I didn't write it.
我不想让人知道我的身份I didn't want anyone to know about me.
可我管不住自己的嘴Then I had to open my big mouth.
你被俘虏了Were you captured?
还是被严刑拷打Tortured?
是精虫上脑Horny.
1546年我结识了一个法国女孩I met a French girl in 1546.
她喜欢听故事Ah, she loved stories.
于是So...
我就给她讲了个很棒的故事I told her a great one.
关于那个留下来的爱好和平的阿斯加德战士All about the peaceful Asgardian warrior who stayed.
我怎么会知道Now, how was I to know
她的牧师哥哥会全记录下来her brother the priest would write it all down
还变成了...传奇and turn it into, I don't know, a thing?
你认识托尔吗Do you know Thor?
当然  我整天跟未来的Oh, sure, I spent all my days palling around
阿斯加德国王厮混with the future king of Asgard.
我当然不认识托尔No, I don't know Thor.

我当然就去参军了Yes, of course I signed up.
我其实就是想到处走走I think, really, I just wanted to travel.
但你有手杖But you had the staff.
我讨厌那玩意I hated that thing.
其他人沉溺于狂怒所带来的力量Other guys loved all the power that comes with the rage.
但我根本不喜欢No, I didn't like it at all.
看起来  你也是And you don't, either, it seems.
那手杖对我做了什么What did it do to me?
它照亮了你内心阴暗的角落It shines a light into your dark places.
不管你是人类  还是阿斯加德人Doesn't matter if you're human, asgardian.
效果都一样The effect is the same --
很不舒服Unpleasant.
"照亮"  说了等于没说"Shines a light." That's no explanation.
手杖由一种稀有金属锻造而成It was forged from a rare metal
对任何持有者都起作用and reacts to whoever is holding it.
或产生互通Or interacts.
我大费周章I went to such great lengths
想把手杖藏好to make sure that the staff wasn't found.
不幸的是  传说被记录了下来Unfortunately, since the myth was written down,
几千年来  一直有人在寻找它people have been searching for it for centuries.
我需要你帮我阻止他们I need your help to stop them
别让他们拿到最后一截手杖before they get the last piece of your staff.
我现在是和平爱好者了Oh, I am a pacifist now.
而且你不希望自己的身份暴露And you don't want to risk your identity being discovered.
听着  不用太担心这些愤怒的年轻人Listen, I wouldn't worry too much about these angry youths.
他们总会冷静下来They always calm down,
最终  衰老死去and eventually, they die of old age.
这就是地球上生命的可贵之处And that is one of the pleasant aspects of life here.
万物变化无穷Everything changes.
我告诉你什么会变化I'll tell you what's gonna change --
你的秘密身份Your anonymity...
除非你帮我找到最后一截手杖Unless you help up find the final piece of your staff.
你可能不认识托尔You may not know Thor.
但我认识But I do.

"靠近上帝""Near god."
手杖所施加的作用The effects of the staff.
是永久的吗Are they permanent?

还有让你觉得心都要炸开的the rage in your chest that makes you feel
胸腔里的那股愤怒as if your heart's about to explode?

鼻子画得不太像  但是Well, the nose isn't quite right, but --

是啊  他们拿我当圣人一样尊崇Yeah. They venerated me a bit as a saint.
他们是白痴They're idiots.
手杖在哪里Where's the staff?
在楼上It's upstairs.
那是正常的沃德还是狂暴沃德Is that the normal Ward or the new, angrier Ward?
分辨不出I can't tell.
好安静It's quiet.
不然我怎么会放心地把秘密交给他们Why do you think I trusted them with my secret?
他们立下了沉默之誓They take a vow of silence.
但如果你逼他们说But when you get them talking...
他们会尖叫[告密]they squeal.
如果你想战胜神If you want to defeat a god,
就得成为神you must become one.

我们知道  但她不懂他的身体构造We know, but she doesn't understand his anatomy.
而我都...And I'm even w--

有时就得采取行动  弄个明白Sometimes, you have to just jump in and figure things out.
阿斯加德人的再生能力比我们快Now, Asgardians regenerate faster than we do.
也许我们能尽量维持他的生命Maybe we can keep him alive long enough--
好让他的身体自愈For his body to heal itself.
那我该找什么Okay, what am I looking for?

科尔森真那么做了Coulson did that?
他就直接把手塞进去了He just shoved his hand inside?
他必须那么做  我僵住了  不知道该怎么办Well, he had to. I froze, didn't know what to do.
你没僵住Hey, you didn't freeze.
你只是不想You just won't be up for the idea

那你是怎么做到的Then how?
你怎么承受得住三截How did you hold all three?

或是待在医院of being in a hospital.
只记得几个月后醒过来Just...woke up a few months later.
你觉得放不下吗  科尔森先生And are you haunted by it, Mr. Coulson?

没有伤害  就不算犯规No harm, no foul.
你就什么都不介意吗Does everything just roll off your back?
